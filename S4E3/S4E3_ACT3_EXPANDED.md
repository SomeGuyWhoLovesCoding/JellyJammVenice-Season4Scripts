## INT. NEW HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

The light has shifted. It's late afternoon now, the sun lower in the sky, casting longer shadows through the hallway windows. The house feels quieter, like it's holding its breath.

Jayride walks back upstairs from the kitchen, his plate empty, his mug drained. He's heading toward his room, his mind elsewhere, when Not Jeremiah appears from one of the other rooms like he's been waiting.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(voice serious)
Hey. I need to talk to you about something.

Jayride stops mid-step. His body language shifts immediately—defensive, wary. He knows this tone.

**JAYRIDE**
(cautious)
What's up?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(stepping closer)
Yesterday. Dan mentioned he saw you doing something near his wall. Near the attic.

Jayride's face goes pale. His eyes widen slightly. He knows exactly what Not Jeremiah is talking about.

**JAYRIDE**
(stammering)
I wasn't—

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(cutting him off, his voice hard)
He said you were playing with yourself. In front of his wall.

Jayride doesn't say anything. He just looks down at his feet, his face flushing red with embarrassment and anger.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(pressing)
Did you touch it? Did you touch the wall?

**JAYRIDE**
(quickly, defensively)
No. No, I didn't touch it. I swear. I was just... I was just standing there. I didn't do anything to it.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(studying him)
Standing there doing what, exactly?

**JAYRIDE**
(frustrated)
I don't know! I was just... I was curious, okay? Everyone keeps talking about this wall like it's some kind of holy relic, and I wanted to see what the big deal was!

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(crossing his arms)
And?

**JAYRIDE**
(getting more animated)
And it's just a wall! I don't get it! It's just drywall and paint! There's nothing special about it! But Dan saw me there and I guess he thought I was doing something I wasn't!

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(voice lowering)
Were you doing something you weren't supposed to be doing?

**JAYRIDE**
(hesitating, then quietly)
I mean... not to the wall.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(closing his eyes, frustrated)
Jesus Christ, Jayride.

**JAYRIDE**
(desperate now)
I didn't touch it! I swear on everything, I did not touch that wall! My hands never went anywhere near it!

Not Jeremiah studies him for a long moment, trying to figure out if he's lying. He watches Jayride's eyes, his body language, looking for tells. Jayride meets his eyes, and something in his expression suggests he's telling the truth—at least about the wall.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(sighing heavily)
Okay. I believe you. But you're still on restriction for one day.

**JAYRIDE**
(confused, angry)
What? Why?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Because you were doing... that... in a common area of the house. That's not okay. We have bathrooms, Jayride.

**JAYRIDE**
(embarrassed, defensive)
I know. I'm sorry. It just... it just happened. I wasn't planning it.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
That somehow makes it worse.

**JAYRIDE**
(looking down)
I know.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(firm)
One day restriction. Don't go near the attic. Don't go near that wall. Understand?

**JAYRIDE**
(quietly)
Yeah. Yeah, I understand.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
And for the love of God, find a better place to do... whatever it is you were doing. This house has three bathrooms. Use one.

**JAYRIDE**
(more embarrassed)
I know. I'm sorry.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(pointing down the hallway)
One day. Starting now. Get out of my sight.

Jayride nods and quickly heads to his room, his shoulders hunched, his face red. He closes the door behind him harder than necessary.

Not Jeremiah watches him go, shaking his head, muttering to himself.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(to himself)
This family is going to be the death of me.

He heads back downstairs, leaving the hallway quiet again.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - JAYRIDE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jayride sits on his bed, staring at nothing. His room is messy—clothes on the floor, posters on the walls, the general chaos of a teenage boy's space.

He's clearly bothered by what just happened. His expression shifts from embarrassment to anger to something darker—something more determined.

**JAYRIDE**
(to himself, quietly)
One day restriction. For something I didn't even do to his precious wall.

He stands up and walks to his window, looking out at the neighborhood beyond. Kids are playing basketball in a driveway across the street. Normal life continuing, oblivious.

**JAYRIDE** (CONT'D)
(his voice getting harder)
One day. I can wait one day.

He turns back to face his room. His eyes are harder now. More focused. A plan is forming.

**JAYRIDE** (CONT'D)
(his voice cold)
But after that... I'm going to ruin that wall. Tonight. When everyone's asleep. I'm going to make Dan regret ever accusing me of something I didn't do.

He nods to himself, as if he's made a decision he can't take back. He sits back on his bed, his mind racing.

**JAYRIDE** (CONT'D)
(quietly, to himself)
One day. Just one day. Then that wall is mine.

He pulls out his phone and starts texting someone. The screen isn't visible to us, but we can see his fingers moving quickly across the keyboard, his expression intense.

After a moment, his phone buzzes. He reads the response and smiles—a cold, calculating smile that doesn't reach his eyes.

**JAYRIDE** (CONT'D)
(to himself, reading)
"I'm in. What's the plan?"

He types back quickly.

**JAYRIDE** (CONT'D)
(whispering as he types)
Perfect. Jayson's in. Now we just need to wait.

He puts his phone down and lies back on his bed, staring at the ceiling, planning, waiting.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Hours have passed. The house is quieter now. It's evening—that transitional time when day becomes night. The living room is dimly lit, with only a single lamp providing light. The TV is off. The house is settling into its nighttime routine.

Most of the family has retreated to their rooms. We can hear distant sounds—a door closing, water running, muffled conversation.

Jayride comes downstairs carefully, moving like he's trying not to make any noise. He's wearing dark clothes now—black hoodie, dark jeans. He looks like he's preparing for something.

He moves through the living room like a ghost, checking things. He looks at the security cameras mounted in the corner—they're off for the night. He checks the TV—off. He peers into the kitchen—dark and empty.

But then he hesitates. He's restless. Anxious. It's only 10:30 PM. Too early. He needs something to do while he waits for midnight, when everyone will be deeply asleep.

He opens the fridge, the light from inside illuminating his face in the darkness.

He stares inside for a moment, looking at the contents. There's leftover pizza, some vegetables, condiments, milk, and—

He spots a whole block of cheese snack sitting on the middle shelf. Not the good cheese. The cheap stuff. But it'll do. He pulls it out and holds it in his hand, looking at it.

**JAYRIDE**
(to himself quietly)
This will do. This will kill some time.

He closes the fridge quietly and sits on the couch in the darkness, eating the cheese block slowly. But even as he eats, he doesn't feel satisfied. He feels bored. Restless. Angry.

**JAYRIDE** (CONT'D)
(to himself, chewing)
Stupid Dan. Stupid wall. It's just drywall. It's nothing special. It's nothing important.

He takes another bite, the cheese bland and unsatisfying in his mouth.

**JAYRIDE** (CONT'D)
(voice rising slightly)
But he treated me like I committed some kind of crime. Like I'm some kind of pervert. All because I was near his stupid wall.

He finishes the cheese block faster than he intended, eating mechanically, not tasting it. He sits back, staring at the ceiling, his jaw clenched.

**JAYRIDE** (CONT'D)
(quietly, with venom)
Well, if he's going to treat me like a criminal, I might as well act like one.

His phone buzzes. He pulls it out and reads the message, the light from the screen illuminating his face.

**JAYRIDE** (CONT'D)
(reading aloud)
"Ready when you are. Got everything we need."

He types back quickly: "Midnight. Meet me at the attic stairs. Bring the supplies."

He puts his phone away and checks the clock on the wall. 10:47 PM.

**JAYRIDE** (CONT'D)
(to himself)
Okay. Just over an hour. I can wait an hour.

He stands up, stretches, and heads back upstairs, moving quietly but with purpose. He needs to kill more time. Maybe play some games on his phone. Maybe watch videos. Anything to make the time pass faster.

The camera follows him as he climbs the stairs, each step careful and measured.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT (LATER)

Time has passed. It's 11:55 PM now. The house is completely dark except for a few night lights in the hallway.

Jayride emerges from his room, dressed in the same dark clothes. He moves to the top of the attic stairs and waits, checking his phone every few seconds.

11:56 PM.
11:57 PM.
11:58 PM.

Then he hears footsteps. Quiet, careful footsteps.

JAYSON appears from around the corner, also dressed in dark clothes, carrying a small backpack. He's being careful, walking on the balls of his feet to avoid making noise.

**JAYSON**
(whispering)
You ready?

**JAYRIDE**
(whispering back)
Yeah. You got everything?

**JAYSON**
(patting the backpack)
Spray paint, markers, and a little something extra.

**JAYRIDE**
(curious)
Extra?

**JAYSON**
(grinning in the darkness)
You'll see. Trust me, this is going to be epic.

**JAYRIDE**
(hesitating)
We have to be quiet. If anyone wakes up—

**JAYSON**
(confident)
Nobody's going to wake up. Everyone's asleep. I checked.

**JAYRIDE**
(worried)
What about Meremiah? Dan said he sometimes checks on the wall at night. What if he's up there?

**JAYSON**
(pulling something from his pocket)
I've got that covered.

He shows Jayride a small packet—melatonin powder.

**JAYRIDE**
(confused)
What is that?

**JAYSON**
(explaining)
Insurance. If Meremiah shows up, we use this. It's medical-grade melatonin. My mom uses it for her insomnia. One dose of this and he'll be knocked out for hours.

**JAYRIDE**
(hesitating, uncertain)
I don't know, man. That seems kind of... dangerous.

**JAYSON**
(dismissive)
It's not dangerous. It's just sleep aid. Natural stuff. It's basically harmless.

**JAYRIDE**
(still uncertain)
But drugging someone without their knowledge—

**JAYSON**
(cutting him off)
Do you want to do this or not? Because if you're going to chicken out, tell me now.

**JAYRIDE**
(after a pause, his anger winning)
No. I want to do this.

**JAYSON**
(satisfied)
Then let's go.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Jayride and Jayson climb the stairs slowly, carefully, making sure each step is silent. The wood creaks occasionally under their weight, and each time it does, they freeze, listening for any sign that someone heard.

But the house remains quiet. Too quiet. The kind of quiet that feels heavy, pregnant with possibility.

**JAYRIDE**
(barely breathing, whisper)
This is insane. What are we doing?

**JAYSON**
(also whispering)
Getting revenge. Keep moving.

They reach the top of the staircase and pause at the entrance to the attic, listening.

Nothing. Just silence and darkness.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC - NIGHT

Jayride pushes open the door and emerges into the attic. It's dark up here—very dark. The only light comes from the moon filtering through the glass ceiling above, creating long shadows across the cluttered space. The boxes and covered furniture look almost sinister in the darkness.

He can make out the shape of Dan's favorite wall in the darkness, highlighted by moonlight. He stands there for a moment, just looking at it.

**JAYRIDE**
(whispering)
There it is. The famous wall.

**JAYSON**
(whispering, coming up behind him)
Doesn't look that special to me.

**JAYRIDE**
(agreeing)
That's because it's not. It's just Dan being weird.

**JAYSON**
(pulling out a flashlight)
Well, let's make it interesting.

Then they hear something.

A sound from the shadows. A movement.

They both freeze, their hearts pounding.

**JAYRIDE**
(barely breathing)
What was that?

**JAYSON**
(tense)
I don't know.

They both spin around, Jayson's flashlight cutting through the darkness.

MEREMIAH is standing near the attic stairs, his back to them initially, facing away. One eye is more open than the other, visible even in the darkness. He's looking half-asleep, like he's been dozing while standing.

Slowly, he turns to face them.

**MEREMIAH**
(groggily, but with suspicion)
What are you doing up here?

**JAYRIDE**
(stammering, caught)
I... I was just...

**MEREMIAH**
(more alert now, stepping toward them)
You're supposed to be on restriction. You're not supposed to be anywhere near the attic.

**JAYRIDE**
(backing up)
I know, I just—

**MEREMIAH**
(cutting him off, his voice firm)
Get out. Now.

**JAYRIDE**
(desperately)
Meremiah, listen—

**MEREMIAH**
(walking toward them)
I'm guarding this wall. Dan doesn't trust you near it, and I'm making sure you don't get anywhere close. I fell asleep, but I'm awake now.

Meremiah moves toward Jayride, his movements slow but deliberate. He starts to nudge him toward the stairs, one hand on Jayride's shoulder.

**MEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
Both of you. Out. Now. I don't know what you're planning, but it's not happening.

But then Jayson steps forward from the shadows.

**JAYSON**
(voice friendly)
Hey. I'm just here to help Jayride find something. We'll only be a minute.

Meremiah, already tired, turns to face Jayson fully now. His eyes narrow suspiciously.

**MEREMIAH**
(firm)
No you're not. Go back downstairs. Both of you.

**JAYSON**
(stepping closer, concerned)
Come on, man. I just want to see the wall. What's the big deal?

**MEREMIAH**
(voice rising)
The big deal is that you're not allowed up here. Neither of you are. Dan was very clear about that. This is his space.

**JAYSON**
(looking at him more closely)
You look tired, Meremiah. Maybe you should go to bed. Let us handle this. We'll just look at the wall for a second and then leave.

**MEREMIAH**
(more alert now, suspicious)
Handle what? What are you planning to do?

**JAYSON**
(innocently)
Nothing. We're not planning anything. We just want to see it.

**MEREMIAH**
(not believing him, moving toward Jayson)
I'm not going anywhere. You two need to leave. Right now. Last warning.

Meremiah moves toward Jayson to physically remove him from the attic, reaching out to grab his arm. But as he does, JAYSON pulls out the small packet of melatonin powder from his pocket with his free hand.

In one quick motion, he opens it and releases the powder into the air, creating a cloud directly in Meremiah's face.

The powder spreads through the attic, floating like dust in the moonlight, glittering particles suspended in the air.

**JAYSON**
(laughing, but there's something manic in it)
This will make everyone have a healthier sleep schedule! You've been looking tired anyway!

He laughs at his own joke—a harsh, almost maniacal laugh that echoes through the attic.

**MEREMIAH**
(realizing what's happening, backing up)
You... you can't... what did you just—

Meremiah starts to protest, but he inhales some of the powder involuntarily. His eyes start getting heavy almost immediately. The melatonin is working faster than it should—way faster.

**MEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(slurring already)
You... drugged me... you can't... do this...

He tries to take a step toward Jayson but his legs won't cooperate properly. His coordination is failing rapidly.

**MEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(weakly, desperately)
Dan... will... find out... he'll...

His words trail off. He staggers backward, trying to steady himself against a stack of boxes, but his hand misses and he loses his balance completely.

He collapses onto a pile of boxes, his eyes closing involuntarily. He's asleep almost instantly, his body going completely limp, his head lolling to one side.

Jayson watches him fall with a grin on his face, the flashlight beam moving erratically as he gestures.

**JAYSON**
(to himself, satisfied)
Perfect. Just perfect.

He pulls out his flashlight properly now and shines it at Jayride, the beam catching him in the face. Jayride shields his eyes.

**JAYSON** (CONT'D)
(whispering urgently)
Come on. We don't have much time.

**JAYRIDE**
(whispering, nervous, looking at Meremiah's unconscious form)
Are you sure about this? What if he doesn't wake up?

**JAYSON**
(whispering back confidently)
He'll wake up. It's just melatonin. He'll be out for like four hours, maybe five. Then he'll wake up with the best sleep of his life.

**JAYRIDE**
(still uncertain)
What if someone comes looking for him?

**JAYSON**
(dismissive)
Nobody's going to come looking for him. Everyone's asleep. We have all the time in the world.

**JAYRIDE**
(looking at Meremiah again)
I don't know, man...

**JAYSON**
(urgent)
Too late to turn back now. Come on. Let's do what we came here to do.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

Jayride wastes no more time. Whatever hesitation he had is gone now, replaced by adrenaline and anger. He heads straight for the favorite wall, Meremiah's unconscious form barely visible in the shadows behind them.

Jayson follows him, shining the flashlight to illuminate the wall in the darkness. The beam of light reveals the pristine white surface—smooth, perfect, untouched. Just like Dan described.

**JAYRIDE**
(looking at it in the flashlight beam)
It really is just a wall. I don't get what Dan sees in it.

**JAYSON**
(shrugging)
Who cares? Let's just do what we came here to do.

**JAYRIDE**
(hesitating one more time)
Are you sure we should do this?

**JAYSON**
(looking at him)
You're the one who texted me. You're the one who wanted revenge. You're the one who said Dan humiliated you. So yeah, I'm sure.

**JAYRIDE**
(his anger returning)
You're right. He did humiliate me. Over nothing.

**JAYSON**
(nodding)
Exactly. So let's give him something real to be upset about.

**JAYRIDE**
(determined now)
Okay. You brought everything?

**JAYSON**
(pulling items from his backpack)
Yeah. Got the spray paint, got the markers, got some other stuff too.

**JAYRIDE**
(curious, nervous)
Other stuff?

**JAYSON**
(grinning in the darkness)
You'll see. It's going to make this even better.

Jayride pulls out a can of spray paint—bright red, the color almost garish in the flashlight beam. He shakes it, and the ball inside rattles loudly in the quiet attic.

**JAYRIDE**
(hesitating one last time)
What should we write?

**JAYSON**
(thinking)
Something that will really get to him. Something that proves we were right and he was wrong.

**JAYRIDE**
(considering)
Like what?

**JAYSON**
(inspiration striking)
How about "Just a wall"? Like, that's literally what it is. Maybe if he sees it written out, he'll realize how stupid his obsession is.

**JAYRIDE**
(grinning now)
Perfect. That's perfect.

Jayride starts spraying. The hissing sound of the spray paint fills the attic, sharp and loud in the quiet. Large red letters appear on the perfect white wall:

"JUST A WALL"

**JAYRIDE** (CONT'D)
(stepping back to admire his work)
Ha! This is actually kind of fun!

**JAYSON**
(laughing)
Right? I told you it would be!

**JAYRIDE**
(getting more into it)
What else should we do?

**JAYSON**
(pulling out markers)
Let's draw something. Something really juvenile. Something that'll make him lose his mind.

They both start drawing on the wall with permanent markers—crude drawings, offensive images, the kind of things teenage boys think are hilarious at midnight. Stick figures in compromising positions. Crude anatomical drawings. Words that would make a sailor blush.

The camera doesn't show the specific details, but it's clear from their laughter and the sounds that what they're doing is deliberately offensive and designed to hurt Dan as much as possible.

**JAYRIDE**
(laughing quietly, almost giggling)
Oh man, he's going to lose his mind when he sees this!

**JAYSON**
(also laughing)
That's the point! That's the whole point!

**JAYRIDE**
(stepping back)
How long do you think we have before someone wakes up?

**JAYSON**
(confident)
Like I said, Meremiah's out cold for at least four hours. We have all the time we need.

**JAYRIDE**
(looking at their work)
This is pretty good. Like, objectively, this is pretty good vandalism.

**JAYSON**
(proudly)
We should do this professionally.

**JAYRIDE**
(laughing)
Professional wall vandals?

**JAYSON**
(serious)
Why not? There's a market for everything. People pay for graffiti art all the time.

**JAYRIDE**
(considering)
True. Though I don't think Dan's going to pay us for this.

**JAYSON**
(grinning)
No. Probably not.

They continue working, occasionally laughing, completely absorbed in their destruction. Minutes pass. Then ten minutes. Then twenty.

**JAYSON** (CONT'D)
(pulling something else from his backpack)
Oh, I almost forgot about this.

**JAYRIDE**
(looking over)
What is it?

Jayson pulls out a bottle of something—the label isn't clearly visible in the darkness, but it's liquid, and it sloshes as he moves it.

**JAYRIDE** (CONT'D)
(concerned)
What is that?

**JAYSON**
(grinning wider)
Something that will make this even better. Something that'll make it really hard to clean.

He starts pouring the liquid on the wall, splashing it across their drawings and the spray paint. The smell hits them immediately—sharp, pungent, unmistakably biological.

**JAYRIDE**
(covering his nose, disgusted)
Oh god, what IS that?

**JAYSON**
(still pouring, laughing)
Let's just say it's going to leave a lasting impression.

**JAYRIDE**
(backing away)
That's disgusting!

**JAYSON**
(finishing pouring, putting the bottle away)
That's the point! Now he can't just paint over it! He's going to have to scrub and clean and maybe even replace the drywall!

**JAYRIDE**
(torn between disgust and admiration)
That's... actually kind of genius.

**JAYSON**
(bowing)
Thank you, thank you.

They both laugh, though Jayride looks slightly uncomfortable now, like he's starting to realize how far they've gone.

The scene continues, the camera pulling back to show their silhouettes against the wall, the flashlight creating dramatic shadows as they work.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC - MUCH LATER

Time has passed. The moon has moved significantly across the sky. The light through the glass ceiling has shifted, indicating hours have gone by.

Jayride and Jayson are still working on the wall, though their energy has started to flag. They've been at it for a long time—almost two hours now.

**JAYRIDE**
(stepping back, tired but satisfied)
You know what? This is actually pretty good. Like, if you ignore the smell and the content, this is actually kind of artistic.

**JAYSON**
(also tired)
I know, right? We should take a picture.

**JAYRIDE**
(immediately concerned)
What? No way.

**JAYSON**
(pulling out his phone)
Why not? We worked hard on this. We should document it.

**JAYRIDE**
(urgent)
Are you insane? If anyone finds those pictures—

**JAYSON**
(dismissive)
They won't. We'll keep them private. Just for us. Come on, we worked for like two hours on this. We should have proof.

**JAYRIDE**
(still hesitating)
I really don't think that's a good idea...

**JAYSON**
(already taking pictures)
Fine. I'll take them myself. You don't have to be in them.

Jayson starts taking pictures of the wall, documenting every angle, every detail. The flash from his phone lights up the attic in brief, bright bursts, making the vandalism look even worse in the stark light.

**JAYRIDE**
(covering his eyes from the flash)
This feels like a really bad idea.

**JAYSON**
(still taking pictures)
Everything we do is a bad idea. That's what makes it fun. That's what makes life interesting.

**JAYRIDE**
(quietly)
I don't think this is fun anymore. I think we should leave.

**JAYSON**
(putting his phone away)
Yeah, okay. We're probably done anyway.

They start gathering their supplies—the spray paint cans, the markers, the empty bottle. Putting everything back in the backpack.

**JAYRIDE**
(looking at the wall one last time)
Do you think he'll forgive us?

**JAYSON**
(shrugging)
I don't know. Do you care?

**JAYRIDE**
(considering)
I don't know. Maybe.

**JAYSON**
(heading toward the stairs)
Well, it's too late now. What's done is done.

They're about to leave when—

Behind them, in the shadows, Meremiah suddenly stirs.

They don't notice at first. They're too focused on packing up and getting out.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

The moon has moved significantly across the sky. The light through the glass ceiling is different now—it's the light of very early morning, that pre-dawn glow that's not quite night and not quite day.

Meremiah's eyes flutter open. He looks confused, disoriented, like he's waking from a dream he can't quite remember. His mouth is dry. His head is pounding.

**MEREMIAH**
(groggily, confused)
What... where...

He sits up slowly, every movement difficult. He looks around, trying to remember where he is, why he's lying on a pile of boxes.

**MEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(to himself, piecing it together)
What happened? Why am I...

Then it starts coming back to him. Jayride. Jayson. The powder. His eyes widen as memory returns.

**MEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(more alert now, alarmed)
The wall.

He hears noises coming from deeper in the attic. Voices. Quiet laughter. The sound of a backpack being zipped.

His eyes widen fully. He's fully alert now despite the grogginess.

**MEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(quietly, to himself)
No. No no no.

He stands up quickly—too quickly. His head spins and he has to steady himself against the boxes. But he pushes through the dizziness and moves toward the sounds, his movements still uncoordinated but determined.

**MEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(louder, calling out)
Who's there? Who's in here?

The voices stop. The movement stops.

Meremiah stumbles forward, still groggy but moving with purpose now. He reaches the spot where the favorite wall is and stops cold.

His face goes pale. His eyes go wide. His mouth opens but no sound comes out at first. He can't speak, can't move, can't process what he's seeing.

The wall is ruined. Completely ruined. Spray paint, marker drawings, that awful smell. Everything Dan loved about it—destroyed.

**MEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(in shock, voice barely above a whisper)
What the...

Then louder, finding his voice, rage replacing shock:

**MEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(screaming)
WHAT DID YOU DO? WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO THE WALL?

JAYRIDE and JAYSON spin around to face him, caught. They look like deer in headlights—guilty, scared, but also defiant.

**JAYRIDE**
(backing away)
Oh shit! He's awake!

**MEREMIAH**
(advancing on them, his voice shaking with rage)
You violated his space! You destroyed the one thing he cared about! The one thing that made him happy!

**JAYSON**
(stepping forward, defensive)
Listen, man, we can explain—

**MEREMIAH**
(voice rising, shaking)
Explain? EXPLAIN? What is there to explain? You drugged me! You waited until I was unconscious and then you... you...

He looks at the wall again, unable to finish the sentence. The full horror of what they've done is sinking in.

**JAYRIDE**
(defensive, but his voice lacks conviction)
It's just a wall! It's just paint and drywall! We can clean it!

**MEREMIAH**
(whirling on him, tears starting to form)
It's not just a wall to him! And you knew that! You knew how much it meant to him and you did this anyway! You did this to hurt him!

**JAYSON**
(getting defensive too)
He was being weird about it! It's unhealthy to be that attached to a wall! We were doing him a favor!

**MEREMIAH**
(advancing, his fists clenched)
That doesn't give you the right to destroy it! That doesn't give you the right to drug me and violate this space!

Meremiah starts moving toward them, his movements still sluggish from the melatonin but filled with anger and purpose. His whole body is shaking—with rage, with the effects of the drug, with the horror of what he's witnessing.

**MEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(voice breaking)
I'm going to wake up Dan. I'm going to wake up everyone. And you two are going to pay for this. You're going to pay for every single thing you did tonight.

**JAYRIDE**
(panicking, backing up)
No, wait—Meremiah, please—

**JAYSON**
(also panicking)
We can fix this! We can clean it up before anyone sees!

**MEREMIAH**
(not listening, moving past them toward the stairs)
Everyone needs to see what you did. Everyone needs to know what kind of people you are.

Jayride looks around frantically, his eyes wild, his breathing rapid. His survival instincts kick in. His eyes land on a shelf near the wall—various items stored there, forgotten by previous owners.

He spots a can. An old can of ant spray, dusty and half-empty, probably left by whoever lived here before.

Without thinking, acting purely on panic and self-preservation, he grabs it.

**JAYSON**
(seeing what Jayride is doing, alarmed)
Jayride, don't—

But Jayride is already moving. He runs toward Meremiah, who has his back turned, heading for the stairs. Meremiah is focused on getting downstairs, on waking everyone up, on making sure justice is served.

Jayride raises the can and sprays it directly at Meremiah's face from behind.

The stream hits Meremiah square in the eyes and nose.

**MEREMIAH**
(screaming, an agonized, primal scream)
AHHHHH! MY EYES! MY FUCKING EYES!

Meremiah staggers backward immediately, his hands flying to his face, trying to cover his eyes, trying to wipe away the burning chemical. But it's in his eyes, in his nose, on his skin, burning like fire.

**MEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(screaming, writhing in pain)
IT BURNS! OH GOD IT BURNS! I CAN'T SEE!

He stumbles over a box and falls to the ground, still screaming, his hands clutching his face desperately.

The sound is horrible—raw, agonized, echoing through the attic and down through the house. It's loud enough to wake the dead. It's loud enough to wake everyone downstairs.

**JAYRIDE**
(dropping the can, horrified at what he's done)
Shit! Shit, shit, shit! I didn't mean—I just—

**JAYSON**
(also panicking now, grabbing Jayride)
What did you do!? Why did you spray him!?

**JAYRIDE**
(voice shaking, tears starting)
I don't know! I panicked! I didn't want him to tell Dan! I didn't want to get in trouble!

**MEREMIAH**
(on the ground, still screaming, writhing)
I CAN'T SEE! I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING! HELP! SOMEONE HELP ME!

**JAYSON**
(urgent, terrified)
We need to hide! Now! Right now!

**JAYRIDE**
(looking at Meremiah)
What about him? We can't just leave him like this!

**JAYSON**
(pulling him)
There's nothing we can do! We made it worse! Come on!

They scramble to find hiding spots in the attic—behind boxes, under old furniture, anywhere they can fit. Their hiding is frantic, desperate, ineffective.

Meremiah continues to scream, stumbling around blindly in the darkness, knocking over boxes, his hands still covering his burning eyes. He crashes into furniture, disoriented and in agony.

**MEREMIAH**
(screaming, crying)
HELP! PLEASE! SOMEONE HELP ME! I CAN'T SEE!

Downstairs, lights start turning on. Voices can be heard—confused, alarmed, urgent.

The damage is done. There's no going back now. The wall is ruined. Meremiah is injured. The night has gone from bad to catastrophic.

And everyone is about to find out what happened.

## END OF ACT 3

**ESTIMATED RUNTIME: 15-18 minutes**

## NOTES FOR PRODUCTION:

- The drugging scene should feel serious, not comedic
- Meremiah's panic and pain should be visceral and real
- The vandalism should be implied more than shown to avoid glorifying it
- The smell should be conveyed through actor reactions
- The ant spray attack should be sudden and shocking
- Lighting should gradually shift from complete darkness to pre-dawn
- Sound design crucial for Meremiah's screams echoing through house
- The boys' panic should feel genuine—they've gone too far
