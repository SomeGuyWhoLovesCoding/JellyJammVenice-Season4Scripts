## INT. NEW HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Dan, Not Jeremiah, and Kelly have all jolted awake from the sound of screaming echoing through the house. They're disoriented, confused, looking around the living room trying to figure out what's happening and where the sound is coming from.

Dan is in his pajamas—mismatched, wrinkled from sleep. His hair is messy, sticking up in odd directions. Not Jeremiah is wearing a t-shirt and sweatpants, rubbing his eyes. Kelly has a blanket wrapped around her shoulders, her face pale with concern.

**DAN**
(groggy but alarmed)
What was that noise? What's happening?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(already on his feet, more alert)
Came from upstairs. Someone's screaming.

**KELLY**
(frightened, clutching her blanket)
Maybe it was Meremiah? It sounded like Meremiah!

**DAN**
(more alert now, fear creeping in)
It sounded like someone was being murdered. Like someone was in serious pain.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(heading toward the stairs)
We should check it out. Make sure everyone's okay.

**KELLY**
(hesitating, scared)
Should we call someone first? Like the police? Or 911?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(pausing)
And tell them what? We heard a scream? They'll think we're paranoid. We need to find out what happened first.

**DAN**
(already moving toward the stairs)
He's right. Let's just go look. It's probably nothing. Maybe Meremiah had a nightmare or something.

**KELLY**
(following reluctantly)
That didn't sound like a nightmare. That sounded real.

They all exchange nervous looks. Something doesn't feel right. The scream was too visceral, too filled with genuine pain.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(taking charge)
Come on. Let's go check it out. Stay together.

But before they can move toward the stairs, Not Jeremiah stops suddenly, holding up his hand.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(thinking)
Actually, let's check down here first. See if anything's wrong on this floor.

**KELLY**
(confused)
Why? The scream came from upstairs.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(explaining)
I know, but what if someone came in through a window or something? What if there's an intruder? We should make sure the first floor is secure before we go up.

**DAN**
(considering this)
That's... actually smart. Really smart.

**KELLY**
(still scared)
Okay, but let's make it quick. Someone up there needs help.

Dan nods and they move through the living room, checking things quickly but thoroughly. Dan heads to the kitchen and spots the fridge. He opens it, the light illuminating his worried face.

**DAN**
(looking inside, noticing)
The cheese snack is gone. Someone ate it.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(walking over)
Who would eat the whole block? That thing was huge.

**KELLY**
(peering over their shoulders)
Was it the good cheese or the cheap cheese?

**DAN**
(turning to look at her, annoyed)
Does it matter right now? Someone is screaming upstairs and you're worried about cheese quality?

**KELLY**
(defensive)
Kind of! If it was the good cheese, we have a real problem. If it was the cheap cheese, then whoever ate it is probably regretting it right now. Maybe that's why someone's screaming!

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(rubbing his face)
Kelly, focus. Please.

**KELLY**
(quietly)
Right. Sorry.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(looking around the kitchen)
Wait. There's something on the counter.

They all walk over to the kitchen counter together. There's a block of cheese sitting there, unwrapped, clearly old and moldy. The wrapper is torn and discarded next to it. The date stamped on the wrapper reads 2026.

**KELLY**
(picking it up, examining it)
This cheese is from 2026. That's... that's really old. Like, three years old.

**DAN**
(suspicious, piecing things together)
Why would someone leave old cheese out? Why would someone eat old cheese and then leave the wrapper?

**KELLY**
(shrugging)
Maybe they forgot about it? Maybe they didn't check the date?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(warning)
Kelly, don't—

But it's too late. Without thinking, driven by her constant hunger and curiosity, Kelly picks up the moldy cheese and takes a small bite, chewing thoughtfully.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(horrified)
Kelly, stop! That's disgusting!

**KELLY**
(mouth full, making a face)
It's fine. It tastes... actually, it tastes really bad. Like, really, really bad.

**DAN**
(disgusted)
You're going to get sick. You're going to get food poisoning.

**KELLY**
(still chewing, swallowing with difficulty)
Probably, but we need to figure out what happened. This could be a clue.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(shaking his head in disbelief)
A clue to what? Who leaves old cheese as a clue?

**KELLY**
(wiping her mouth, looking thoughtful)
Someone who wants us to know they were here. Someone who wanted to leave a message. Like a breadcrumb trail.

**DAN**
(skeptical)
Or someone who's just really bad at cleaning out the fridge and has terrible eating habits.

**KELLY**
(defensive of her theory)
It could be a message!

Suddenly, heavy footsteps on the stairs. Uneven footsteps. Someone coming down slowly, painfully.

They all freeze, turning toward the sound.

Meremiah appears at the bottom of the stairs, looking absolutely terrible. His eyes are red and watery, swollen almost completely shut. Tears are streaming down his face—not from emotion, but from the chemical burn. He looks like he's been crying for hours. He's moving slowly, unsteadily, one hand on the wall to guide himself, the other rubbing at his eyes uselessly.

**MEREMIAH**
(voice hoarse, pained)
What's going on? Why is everyone up?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(rushing toward him, concerned)
Meremiah! What happened to you? Your eyes—they look terrible!

**MEREMIAH**
(voice breaking, filled with pain and anger)
I got sprayed. With something. Ant spray, I think. Some kind of insecticide. I was upstairs and—

His voice breaks. He's clearly in pain, both physical and emotional. He can barely keep his eyes open.

**DAN**
(alarmed, stepping closer)
Sprayed? Why would someone spray you? Who did this?

**MEREMIAH**
(wiping his eyes, wincing from the pain)
Because I caught them doing something. Something bad. Upstairs. In the attic.

The color drains from Dan's face completely. Not Jeremiah and Dan look at each other, and their expressions shift from confusion to concern to dawning horror.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(voice low, serious)
Who? Who did you catch?

**MEREMIAH**
(looking directly at Dan, his voice filled with anger and pain)
Jayride and Jayson. They were doing something to the wall. Your wall, Dan. Your favorite wall.

Dan's entire body goes rigid. His face goes completely white. His hands start to shake.

**DAN**
(quietly, barely a whisper)
No. No, they wouldn't. They wouldn't do that.

**MEREMIAH**
(his voice harder now)
They did. I tried to stop them, but Jayson used melatonin powder on me. Medical-grade stuff. Knocked me out cold. When I woke up, they were still there, finishing up, and Jayride... Jayride sprayed me in the face when I tried to stop them again.

Dan starts shaking visibly. His hands clench into fists. His breathing becomes rapid and shallow.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(putting his hand on Dan's shoulder, trying to steady him)
We need to go up there. We need to see what happened.

**DAN**
(voice shaking with anger and fear)
What did they do to it? What did they do to my wall?

**MEREMIAH**
(looking down, unable to meet his eyes)
I don't know exactly. I didn't get a good look before I got sprayed. My eyes were burning too much to see clearly. But it was bad, Dan. Really bad. The smell alone...

**DAN**
(voice rising, panicking)
How bad? HOW bad?

**MEREMIAH**
(quietly, seriously)
Bad enough that you're going to want to see it for yourself. Bad enough that... I'm sorry, Dan. I tried to stop them. I really tried.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(firmly, taking charge)
Let's go. We need to see this. We need to know what we're dealing with.

**KELLY**
(worried)
Should I come?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(nodding)
Yeah. We might need you. We might need everyone.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(pausing)
But first, let me check the rest of downstairs to make sure nothing else is wrong. Something feels off.

He moves through the house quickly, checking rooms, looking for anything out of place. Then he stops in the hallway, his expression changing to confusion.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(calling out)
All the drawers are open. Why are all the drawers open?

**KELLY**
(walking over to look)
Every single one?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(checking each one methodically)
Yeah. Every drawer in the hallway. Every drawer in the kitchen. Every single one is pulled open. What the hell is going on?

**DAN**
(frustrated, voice breaking, almost shouting)
I don't know! I don't care about the drawers! But we need to get upstairs! We need to see what they did to my wall!

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(returning to the group)
Okay, okay. You're right. Let's go. Now.

**KELLY**
(following)
This is really scary, you guys.

**MEREMIAH**
(leading the way despite his injured eyes)
You have no idea.

They all head upstairs together, Meremiah leading the way despite his condition, his hand still on the wall for guidance. Dan is shaking, barely holding himself together. Not Jeremiah looks grim and serious. Kelly brings up the rear, still clutching her blanket.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

They reach the upstairs hallway. The house feels different now—threatening, violated. The shadows seem darker. The air feels heavier.

**DAN**
(to Meremiah, his voice desperate)
Where are they? Are they still up there?

**MEREMIAH**
(nodding painfully)
They were hiding when I came down. Behind boxes. But they're up there. I heard them moving around.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(grimly)
Let's go.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

They climb the attic stairs together, each step feeling heavier than the last. Dan is shaking visibly, his breathing rapid and shallow. He knows something terrible has happened. He can feel it.

**DAN**
(to himself, a desperate prayer)
Please don't let it be bad. Please don't let it be too bad. Please...

But even as he says it, he knows. He can feel it in his bones.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

They reach the attic and stop in their tracks.

The smell hits them first—that sickening, unmistakable smell that Jayson poured on the wall. It fills the attic, making it hard to breathe. Kelly immediately gags and covers her mouth and nose with her blanket.

**KELLY**
(covering her mouth, gagging)
Oh god. What is that smell? What IS that?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(grimly, also covering his nose)
I don't want to know.

Then Dan sees his favorite wall.

He doesn't move. He doesn't speak. He can't. He just stares at it, at what's been done to it.

The pristine white surface he loved—completely destroyed. Spray paint in bright red: "JUST A WALL." Crude drawings in permanent marker. That awful smell coming from whatever liquid they poured on it. Everything he loved about it, everything that made it perfect—gone.

It's completely ruined.

**DAN**
(quietly, in shock, barely breathing)
No. No, no, no.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(stepping closer, putting his hand on Dan's shoulder)
Oh god. Dan, I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

Dan walks toward the wall slowly, like he's in a trance, like he's moving through water. He stops in front of it, his hand reaching out but not quite touching it, as if he's afraid it will hurt him if he makes contact.

Looking at the vandalism up close, his hand trembling in the air inches from the surface.

**DAN**
(voice breaking)
They... they destroyed it. They destroyed everything. Everything I loved about it is gone.

Dan's face crumples. His eyes fill with tears. He starts crying—not quietly, but openly, his whole body shaking with sobs. He falls to his knees in front of the wall, his hands covering his face.

**DAN** (CONT'D)
(sobbing, his voice raw)
Why? Why would they do this? I never did anything to them! I just wanted one thing! One perfect thing that was mine!

**KELLY**
(stepping forward, her own eyes filling with tears, putting her hand on his shoulder)
Dan, I'm so sorry. This is horrible.

**DAN**
(pulling away from her, still crying, still on his knees)
Don't. Just don't touch me. Don't say anything.

He falls forward, his hands on the floor in front of the wall, his whole body shaking with grief and rage.

**DAN** (CONT'D)
(through sobs, to the wall)
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry I couldn't protect you. I promised I would protect you and I failed.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(looking around the attic, his voice hard)
Where are they? Where are Jayride and Jayson?

He scans the attic, his eyes adjusting to the dim pre-dawn light filtering through the glass ceiling. Then he spots movement behind a stack of boxes in the corner.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(pointing, his voice cold and hard)
There. They're hiding over there.

Jayride and Jayson are crouched in the shadows of the attic, half-hidden behind boxes and old furniture, trying to stay out of sight. But Not Jeremiah spots them immediately.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(his voice like ice)
Get over here. Right now. Both of you.

Jayride and Jayson slowly emerge from the shadows, moving like condemned prisoners walking to execution. They both look guilty, scared, but there's also something defiant in their expressions—like they're trying to convince themselves they did the right thing, that Dan deserved this.

**JAYRIDE**
(defensive, but his voice wavers)
We didn't mean for it to get this bad.

**DAN**
(turning to face them, tears still streaming down his face, his voice raw with pain)
You didn't mean for it to get this bad? LOOK AT IT! Look at what you did!

He gestures at the wall, his hand shaking.

**DAN** (CONT'D)
(screaming now)
LOOK AT WHAT YOU DID TO MY WALL!

**JAYSON**
(defensively, stepping forward)
It's just a wall, man. We can clean it. We can paint over it.

**DAN**
(his voice breaking, screaming)
It's not just a wall! It was MY wall! It was the one thing in this entire house that was mine! The one thing nobody else cared about, the one thing that was perfect and untouched and MINE! And you destroyed it!

**KELLY**
(quietly to Not Jeremiah, shocked)
I've never seen him like this. I've never seen him this upset.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(quietly back, also shocked)
Neither have I. Not even close.

**DAN**
(still shouting, his voice cracking)
Do you have any idea what this meant to me? Any idea at all? Do you have any concept of what you took from me?

**JAYRIDE**
(defensive, but his voice is uncertain)
No! No, we don't! Because it's insane! It's a wall! It's paint and drywall and studs! It's not a person! It's not even a thing that actually matters!

**DAN**
(screaming)
It mattered to ME! That's what matters! It was mine and it was perfect and YOU DESTROYED IT!

**JAYSON**
(stepping forward, getting angry too)
Well maybe you need to get your priorities straight then! Maybe you need to care about something real instead of a stupid wall! This is unhealthy! This obsession is unhealthy!

Dan lunges at Jayson, his hands reaching for him, his face twisted with rage and grief. But Not Jeremiah catches him, wrapping his arms around Dan from behind and holding him back.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(holding Dan back, struggling)
Stop! Dan, stop!

**DAN**
(struggling against Not Jeremiah's grip, trying to get free)
Let me go! Let me at them! Let me—

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(holding firm, his voice urgent)
No! This isn't going to help! Violence isn't going to fix the wall!

Dan struggles for a moment longer, but then the fight goes out of him. He stops struggling, but he's still shaking with anger and grief, tears streaming down his face, his breathing ragged.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(still holding him, speaking firmly)
Breathe. Just breathe.

**DAN**
(his voice breaking)
They destroyed it. They destroyed the only thing I had.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(to Jayride and Jayson, his voice cold)
You two. Explain. Right now. Why did you do this?

**JAYRIDE**
(looking down, unable to meet anyone's eyes)
Because... because we were bored. And angry. And it seemed like fun at the time. Like it would be funny.

**KELLY**
(horrified)
Fun? You thought destroying someone's property was fun? You thought hurting someone was funny?

**JAYSON**
(defensive)
It's not property. It's a wall. In a house we all live in. It belongs to all of us, not just him.

**DAN**
(quietly, dangerously)
No. It was mine. And you knew that. You knew exactly what you were doing.

**MEREMIAH**
(from near the stairs, still in pain, his voice hard)
They took pictures too. I saw them. They were documenting it. Taking photos like it was some kind of trophy.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(turning to them, his voice rising)
Is that true? Did you take pictures?

Jayride and Jayson exchange glances. The guilt on their faces is answer enough.

**JAYSON**
(quietly, admitting it)
Yeah. We took some pictures.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(his voice filled with disgust)
Why would you do that? Why would you document this?

**JAYRIDE**
(stammering, trying to explain)
We thought... we thought it would be funny to look back on. Like a memory. Like something we could laugh about later.

**DAN**
(his voice breaking again, crying)
A memory. You wanted to remember the time you destroyed something I loved. You wanted to preserve this moment.

**JAYSON**
(defensive, angry)
We didn't know you loved it that much! We thought it was just a weird obsession! We thought you needed to be taught a lesson!

**DAN**
(screaming through tears)
This was my wall! This was the only thing I had that was completely, perfectly mine!

Not Jeremiah walks over to Dan, still holding him, and puts both hands on his shoulders, turning him to face him.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(looking Dan in the eyes)
Hey. Hey, look at me. Look at me.

Dan looks up at him, tears streaming down his face, his eyes red and swollen.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(firmly, kindly)
Your obsession with this wall doesn't define you. You know that, right? You're more than this. You're more than what they did to it.

**DAN**
(shaking his head)
You don't understand. Nobody understands.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(gently)
Then help me understand. Why is this wall so important? What does it mean to you?

**DAN**
(his voice breaking, the words pouring out)
Because it's the only thing that was just mine. Everything else in my life is shared. My room, my stuff, my time, my space. Everyone always wants something from me. Everyone always has expectations. Be funny. Be energetic. Be helpful. Be quiet. Be different. But this wall... this wall didn't want anything. It didn't expect anything. It just existed. And it was perfect. And it was mine.

**KELLY**
(softly, moved)
Dan...

**DAN**
(continuing, tears streaming)
And they took that from me. They took the one thing that gave me peace and they ruined it. They destroyed it. They violated it. And they took pictures to remember it by.

There's a long silence. Nobody knows what to say. The weight of what Dan is feeling fills the entire attic.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(finally, quietly)
I know. And I'm sorry. But we can fix it. We're going to make them clean it up. We're going to make this right.

**DAN**
(shaking his head)
It won't be the same. It'll never be the same. Even if we clean it, even if we repaint it, I'll always know what happened. I'll always see this when I look at it.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(firmly)
Maybe not. But it'll still be yours. And we're going to make sure nobody ever touches it again.

Dan wipes his eyes and nods weakly, though he doesn't look convinced.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(to Jayride and Jayson, his voice hard and commanding)
You two. You're going to clean this up. Every inch of it. Every mark, every smell, everything. And while you do, we're going to draw a line here. A boundary around this wall. And if you ever erase that line, if you ever touch this wall again, your punishment will be twice as long. Do you understand me?

**JAYRIDE**
(quietly, defeated)
Yeah. We understand.

**JAYSON**
(also quietly)
We're sorry. We really are sorry.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(coldly)
I don't want to hear it. Just start cleaning.

**KELLY**
(to Not Jeremiah)
What about their phones? They took pictures. We should take their phones.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(nodding)
Good point. Excellent point. Hand them over. Now.

**JAYRIDE**
(hesitating)
What?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(his voice harder)
Your phones. Give them to me. Right now.

Reluctantly, Jayride pulls his phone from his pocket and hands it over, his hand shaking slightly. Jayson hesitates, looking at his phone like it's the last connection to freedom he has.

**JAYSON**
(protesting weakly)
I need my phone for—

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(cutting him off)
I don't care. I don't care what you need it for. Hand it over. Now.

Jayson slowly pulls his phone from his pocket and gives it to Not Jeremiah, his face sullen.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(holding both phones)
We'll deal with these later. Delete those photos. But right now, you clean. You clean until this wall is as close to perfect as you can make it.

Dan walks over to the wall slowly, his hand trembling as he points to where he wants the boundary line drawn. Not Jeremiah takes a permanent marker from his pocket and carefully draws a square around the wall, marking its boundaries clearly and precisely.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(drawing)
This is it. This is the line. You don't cross it. Ever. This is sacred space now.

**DAN**
(watching the line being drawn, his voice quiet)
Make it bigger. Give it more space. I don't want anyone getting close.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
How much bigger?

**DAN**
At least two feet on each side. Maybe three. I don't want anyone coming close to it. I don't want anyone breathing on it.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(adjusting the square, making it larger)
Like this?

**DAN**
(nodding)
Yeah. That's good. That's perfect.

Jayride and Jayson nod silently and start looking for cleaning supplies. They find some old rags and cleaning products in a corner of the attic—left by previous owners—and get to work, their movements slow and reluctant.

**JAYRIDE**
(quietly to Jayson while gathering supplies)
This is going to take hours. Maybe all night.

**JAYSON**
(quietly back)
I know. I know.

**JAYRIDE**
Do you think they'll ever forgive us?

**JAYSON**
(looking at Dan, who's watching them intensely with red, swollen eyes)
I don't know. Would you? If someone did this to you?

**JAYRIDE**
(pausing, considering)
Probably not. No. I wouldn't.

They start cleaning in silence, the only sounds their scrubbing and Dan's occasional sniffling.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC - LATER

Time has passed. Maybe an hour. Jayride and Jayson are scrubbing the wall down, trying to clean it as best they can, but it's not coming off easily. Dan watches them intensely from a few feet away, his arms crossed, making sure they don't miss a spot. His eyes are still red from crying, but the tears have stopped for now.

Kelly has left to go back downstairs, unable to handle the smell anymore. Meremiah is sitting on a box nearby, holding a cold compress to his eyes, still in pain but able to see a little better now.

**DAN**
(to Jayride, pointing)
You missed a spot. Right there. In the corner.

**JAYRIDE**
(looking, exhausted)
Where?

**DAN**
(his voice hard)
Right there. The corner. There's still red marker visible.

Jayride scrubs harder at the corner, the rag making squeaking sounds against the wall. His arms are getting tired, but he doesn't stop.

**JAYSON**
(to Jayride, also exhausted)
Is it coming off?

**JAYRIDE**
(frustrated, breathing hard)
Barely. This stuff is really stuck on here. The permanent marker especially. It's like it bonded with the paint.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(from where he's standing guard)
Good. That's what you get for using permanent marker. That's what permanent means.

**JAYSON**
(defensive, but weak)
We didn't think—

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(cutting him off)
That's right. You didn't think. That's the problem. That's always the problem with you two.

They continue scrubbing in silence. Water spills and accidentally washes over part of the boundary line that was drawn, smudging it slightly. Dan watches but nods.

**DAN**
That's okay. As long as you don't erase the corners. The corners are the important part.

**JAYRIDE**
We won't. I promise. We won't touch the corners.

They keep cleaning, their hands getting raw from the scrubbing, their backs aching from bending over. The smell is slowly dissipating, but it's still there, clinging to everything.

Suddenly, a loud CRASH from outside the attic. Not a window breaking, but a window being opened forcefully. The sound of wood scraping against wood.

Everyone freezes.

**DAN**
(alarmed)
What was that?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(moving toward the sound)
I don't know. Stay here.

MR. HOLT (50s, weathered face, serious expression, wearing work clothes) climbs through the attic window with a crowbar in his hand. He looks shocked, taking in the scene—Jayride and Jayson cleaning with red, exhausted faces, Dan watching with swollen eyes, Meremiah holding a compress to his face, the wall still showing signs of vandalism despite the cleaning, that awful smell still lingering.

**MR. HOLT**
(looking around in shock and anger)
What in god's name happened here?

Everyone freezes. Nobody was expecting Mr. Holt to show up like this, especially not through a window.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(surprised, confused)
Mr. Holt? What are you doing here? How did you—

**MR. HOLT**
(climbing through the window fully, putting down the crowbar)
Your neighbors heard screaming from outside while I was doing my night security rounds in the area. Someone heard bloody murder and called me. I thought someone was being killed. The front door was locked, so I came through the window.

**MEREMIAH**
(still holding the compress, his voice hoarse)
That was me. I got sprayed with ant spray. I was screaming because it burned.

**MR. HOLT**
(walking toward Meremiah, looking at his eyes with concern)
Jesus Christ. Who did that to you? Your eyes look terrible.

**MEREMIAH**
(pointing at Jayride with his free hand)
He did. Jayride sprayed me in the face when I tried to stop them from vandalizing the wall.

Mr. Holt's expression darkens considerably. He looks at Jayride, then at Jayson, then at the wall, taking it all in. His jaw clenches. His hands ball into fists.

**MR. HOLT**
(slowly, dangerously)
Somebody better start explaining what happened here. Right now. All of it.

**DAN**
(explaining quickly, his voice still raw)
They... they did stuff to my wall. Bad stuff. Really bad stuff. They vandalized it with spray paint and markers and... and other things. And they took pictures of it. And they drugged Meremiah and then sprayed him when he tried to stop them. So we're making them clean it up.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(adding)
They drugged him with medical-grade melatonin powder. Knocked him unconscious. And then when he woke up and tried to stop them, Jayride sprayed him in the face with ant spray. Chemical assault.

Mr. Holt surveys the scene, his eyes moving from the wall to the two boys to Meremiah's injured face. His expression gets darker and darker. His hands clench and unclench.

**MR. HOLT**
(to Jayride and Jayson, his voice low and hard)
You two are restricted from the attic. Indefinitely. You don't come up here. You don't even think about coming up here. Understand?

**JAYRIDE**
(quietly, scared)
Yes sir.

**JAYSON**
(also quietly)
Yes sir.

He walks over to them, his heavy work boots making loud sounds on the attic floor. The sound is ominous, threatening. He reaches out and takes the phones from Not Jeremiah, who hands them over without question.

**MR. HOLT**
(holding the phones)
Let me see what you've been doing. Let me see what kind of people you really are.

He starts scrolling through one of them, his expression getting darker with each swipe.

**MR. HOLT** (CONT'D)
(checking the browser)
You were in incognito mode. Smart. Trying to hide something?

**JAYRIDE**
(nervously)
Yeah, we were, but we turned it off before—

Mr. Holt opens the regular browser. His face goes pale as he sees what pops up on the screen. His hands start shaking.

There are 83 open tabs—all pornographic sites, all extremely explicit content.

**MR. HOLT**
(quietly, in shock)
Eighty-three tabs?

He keeps scrolling, his hands shaking more. The number keeps going up. 202 inactive tabs. More of the same. Worse, even.

**MR. HOLT** (CONT'D)
(his voice rising)
Two hundred and two? TWO HUNDRED AND TWO?

**JAYSON**
(desperately trying to explain)
Those ad pop-ups kept opening! Every site we went to had the same ad! And when we clicked on one, it just opened more tabs! We couldn't stop them! That's how we lost track of how many we had!

**JAYRIDE**
(nodding frantically)
Yeah, it's like a virus or something! We tried to close them but they just kept opening more! We didn't mean to have that many!

**MR. HOLT**
(staring at the phone, his hands shaking, his voice thick with emotion)
Do you have any idea what you're doing to yourselves? Any idea at all?

**JAYSON**
(stammering)
We were just—

**MR. HOLT**
(cutting him off, his voice breaking)
Just what? Just destroying your minds? Just corrupting yourselves? Just turning into people who violate other people's property and poison other people and LIE about it? Just becoming the kind of people who document their crimes like they're proud of them?

His hands are shaking badly now. His eyes fill with tears—not from sadness, but from anger and disappointment so profound it's physically affecting him.

He sits down heavily on a nearby box, still holding the phone, looking at the screen like it's a window into hell itself.

**MR. HOLT** (CONT'D)
(quietly, his voice thick)
What are you two doing to yourselves? What kind of people are you becoming?

Meremiah stands up from where he was sitting, having heard everything. He looks at the scene unfolding—at Mr. Holt's devastation, at the boys' shame, at Dan's grief.

**MEREMIAH**
(to Jayride and Jayson, his voice hard)
You two need to leave. Get out of this attic.

**JAYRIDE**
(gesturing to the wall)
We're trying to clean—

**MEREMIAH**
(voice rising, shaking with anger)
I said LEAVE!

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(stepping forward)
Actually, they need to finish cleaning first. They need to fix what they broke.

**MEREMIAH**
(voice rising to a scream, all his pent-up rage releasing)
They sprayed me! One of them sprayed me in the face with POISON! I CAN BARELY SEE!

**JAYRIDE**
(stepping forward, his voice breaking)
It was me. I'm the one who did it. I sprayed you. Jayson didn't do that part. That was all me.

**JAYSON**
(quickly, also stepping forward)
But I did the melatonin thing. That was me. I drugged him. That was my idea.

For a moment, Dan looks like he's about to say something harsh, something cruel. But then his expression softens. He looks at Meremiah—really looks at him—and sees the pain in his face, the redness of his eyes, the way he's still holding the compress. He realizes Meremiah got hurt trying to protect something that mattered to him. He starts feeling empathy, compassion.

**DAN**
(to Not Jeremiah, his voice softer)
He got hurt. Meremiah got hurt trying to protect my wall. He was trying to help me.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(nodding, also softening)
Yeah. He did. He tried to stop them and they hurt him.

Dan and Not Jeremiah both start crying again—not the loud, agonized sobbing from before, but quiet tears running down their faces. The reality of what happened, the violence of it, the violation of it, is hitting them all at once. This wasn't just about a wall. This was about trust, about safety, about people hurting each other.

Kelly's voice floats up from the hallway at the bottom of the attic stairs.

**KELLY** (O.S.)
(from downstairs)
Hey, can I come in? I heard Mr. Holt's voice.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(wiping his eyes, calling down)
No. The attic is in maintenance right now. Stay downstairs.

**KELLY** (O.S.)
Okay. Let me know if you need anything.

They hear her footsteps heading back downstairs.

There's a moment of heavy silence. Everyone is processing what's happened, what's still happening.

Then Meremiah's face changes. His expression shifts from pain to pure, unfiltered rage.

**MEREMIAH**
(suddenly screaming at the top of his lungs)
YOU FUCKING WHAT!?

Everyone jumps at the sudden outburst. The words echo through the attic.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(startled)
Meremiah, calm down—

**MEREMIAH**
(still screaming, his voice raw)
CALM DOWN!? THEY POISONED ME! THEY VIOLATED DAN'S SPACE! THEY DRUGGED ME AND THEN SPRAYED CHEMICALS IN MY EYES! AND THEY TOOK PICTURES OF IT LIKE IT WAS SOME KIND OF JOKE! LIKE IT WAS ENTERTAINMENT!

**DAN**
(putting his hand on Meremiah's shoulder gently, trying to calm him)
I know. I know. But yelling isn't going to fix it. It's not going to change what happened.

**MEREMIAH**
(his voice breaking, tears streaming down his face)
I tried to protect the wall. I tried to do what you asked. I stayed up here. I guarded it. And I failed. I failed you.

**DAN**
(firmly, sincerely)
You didn't fail. You got hurt trying to protect something that mattered to me. That means something. That means everything. You didn't fail—they did.

**MEREMIAH**
(sitting back down on his box, his anger deflating into exhaustion)
Does it? Does it really mean anything if the wall is still destroyed?

**DAN**
(kneeling beside him)
Yeah. It does. Because you tried. Because you cared enough to try. That matters more than the wall itself.

Mr. Holt stands up slowly, still holding the phones. His expression has changed—there's something harder in his eyes now, something dangerous and determined.

**MR. HOLT**
(to Jayride and Jayson, his voice steady but threatening)
You two need to understand something. What you did tonight wasn't just a prank. It wasn't just kids being stupid or making a mistake. You violated someone's trust. You poisoned someone. You documented your crimes like they were entertainment, like they were achievements to be proud of.

**JAYRIDE**
(quietly, genuinely scared)
We know. We're sorry. We're really, really sorry.

**MR. HOLT**
(his voice rising)
Sorry doesn't cut it. Sorry doesn't undo what you did. Sorry doesn't un-burn Meremiah's eyes. Sorry doesn't restore that wall. You need to feel the weight of what you've done. You need to understand that actions have consequences.

He takes a step toward them, and there's something dangerous in his eyes now—something that makes both boys take an involuntary step back.

**MR. HOLT** (CONT'D)
(dangerously quiet)
And I'm going to make sure you understand.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(cautiously, sensing where this is going)
Mr. Holt, what are you—

Mr. Holt doesn't answer. He doesn't give any warning.

## FADE OUT

## END OF ACT 4

**ESTIMATED RUNTIME: 16-18 minutes**

---

## NOTES FOR PRODUCTION:

- Dan's grief should feel genuine and devastating
- The moldy cheese bit provides brief dark humor relief
- Meremiah's pain needs to be visceral and real
- Mr. Holt's arrival should shift the energy completely
- The pornography discovery should feel like a gut-punch revelation
- Build tension gradually toward Mr. Holt's violence
- The boundary line drawing should feel ritualistic, important
- End on clear foreshadowing of violence to come
