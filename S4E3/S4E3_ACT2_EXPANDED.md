## INT. NEW HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY (LATER)

The afternoon light filters through a window at the end of the hallway, creating long shadows. The house has settled into a comfortable quiet—the kind of quiet that comes after the chaos of moving has subsided.

Not Jeremiah comes up the stairs, moving at his usual measured pace. He finds Meremiah leaning against the hallway wall near his room, arms crossed, one eye more open than the other. Meremiah looks like he's been waiting there, though for what or whom is unclear.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(stopping)
Hey. You seen Dan?

**MEREMIAH**
(not moving from his position)
He's probably still up in the attic with that wall of his.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(sighing)
Yeah, what's the deal with that wall anyway? I mean, I tried to understand it, but it's just a wall.

**MEREMIAH**
(shrugging slightly)
I know. I tried telling him that. He kicked out those two kids—Jayson and Joyride—because they made fun of it.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(surprised)
Seriously? Over a wall?

**MEREMIAH**
(nodding)
Over a wall.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(shaking his head)
That's... I mean, I get having preferences and quirks, but a wall? Like, what makes it so special?

**MEREMIAH**
(considering)
I asked him once. He said it's the only thing in this house that's completely his. Nobody else cares about it, so it's pure. Untouched.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(thinking about this)
That's kind of sad when you think about it.

**MEREMIAH**
(agreeing)
Yeah. But also kind of weird. It's literally just drywall and paint. There's nothing objectively special about it.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Did you try to explain that to him? The objective lack of specialness?

**MEREMIAH**
(nodding)
Multiple times. He doesn't want to hear it. Says I wouldn't understand because I don't have anything I care about that much.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(curious)
Do you?

**MEREMIAH**
(pausing, genuinely considering)
I don't know. Maybe not. Maybe that's the problem. Maybe I'm the weird one for not caring about anything.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(leaning against the wall next to him)
That's pretty philosophical.

**MEREMIAH**
(shrugging again)
It's just the truth. Everyone else has their things. Kelly has food. Dan has the wall. You have... what do you have?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(thinking)
I don't know. Order, maybe? Structure? I like when things make sense.

**MEREMIAH**
(almost smiling)
So you care about abstract concepts and Dan cares about a physical wall. Which one of you is weirder?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(laughing)
Fair point.

They both stand there for a moment, not really getting it but accepting it anyway. The hallway is quiet except for the distant sound of a TV from downstairs.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(pushing off the wall)
Well, at least he found something that makes him happy. Even if it's weird.

**MEREMIAH**
(agreeing)
True. Better than nothing.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(curious)
Do you think we should check on him? Make sure he's not doing anything strange up there?

**MEREMIAH**
(shaking his head)
Nah. Let him have his moment with the wall. He'll come down when he's ready. Or when he gets hungry. Whichever comes first.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(smiling)
Probably hunger. Dan's appetite is almost as intense as his enthusiasm.

**MEREMIAH**
Almost?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(reconsidering)
Okay, equally intense.

**MEREMIAH**
(nodding)
That's more accurate.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(stretching)
Anyway, I was going downstairs to get some mac and cheese. Kelly's probably making some. You hungry?

**MEREMIAH**
(perking up slightly)
Mac and cheese sounds good. Tell Kelly I'm coming down.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(starting toward the stairs)
She's probably already cooking it. You know how she is.

**MEREMIAH**
(following)
Always eating.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Always.

**MEREMIAH**
(pausing)
Do you think that's her thing? Her equivalent of Dan's wall?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(considering)
Food?

**MEREMIAH**
Yeah. Like, Dan has the wall. Kelly has food. You have order. I have... nothing.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(stopping on the stairs)
Maybe your thing is having nothing. Maybe that's the thing itself.

**MEREMIAH**
(frowning)
That's depressing.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Or it's freeing. Not being attached to anything means you can't lose anything.

**MEREMIAH**
(thinking about this)
Huh. I never thought about it that way.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
See? You're not weird. You're just... emotionally efficient.

**MEREMIAH**
(almost smiling)
Emotionally efficient. I like that.

They start heading down the stairs together, their footsteps echoing in the stairwell.

**MEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(after a pause)
Do you think Dan's relationship with the wall is healthy?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(considering carefully)
I think... I think it's not hurting anyone. So even if it's weird, it's not unhealthy.

**MEREMIAH**
But what if it becomes more important than people?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Has it?

**MEREMIAH**
I don't know. Maybe. He kicked those kids out pretty fast.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
They were being disrespectful. I might've done the same thing.

**MEREMIAH**
(skeptical)
Really?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(shrugging)
Okay, maybe not. But I understand why he did it.

## INT. NEW HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Not Jeremiah and Meremiah head downstairs into the kitchen. The kitchen is bright and clean—one of the few rooms that actually looks organized and lived-in. Pots and pans are in their designated places. The fridge is humming quietly. Everything has a place, and everything is in its place.

KELLY (17, always eating, always snacking, perpetually in the kitchen) is already at the kitchen counter. She's got a box of mac and cheese sitting in front of her, and she's in the process of preparing it with the focused attention of a surgeon.

**KELLY**
(not looking up)
Hey, you guys want some? I'm making a big batch.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(sitting at the table)
Yeah, grab me some.

**MEREMIAH**
(leaning against the counter)
Make it a lot.

**KELLY**
(pouring pasta into the pot)
When do I ever make a small batch?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(laughing)
True. Remember when you made mac and cheese for like fifteen people and there were only six of us?

**KELLY**
(defensive)
That was one time! And we ate all of it eventually!

**MEREMIAH**
Over three days.

**KELLY**
(turning to face them)
Still counts. Food eaten is food not wasted.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Can't argue with that logic.

**MEREMIAH**
(pushing off the counter)
Where'd you learn to cook, anyway?

**KELLY**
(stirring the pot)
YouTube. And trial and error. Mostly error at first.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Remember the time you tried to make pasta from scratch?

**KELLY**
(groaning)
Don't remind me. It was like eating rubber bands.

**MEREMIAH**
(smirking)
Expensive rubber bands.

**KELLY**
(pointing the spoon at him)
We agreed never to speak of that again.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(grinning)
And yet here we are, speaking of it.

Kelly starts heating up water on the stove. Not Jeremiah is already sitting at the kitchen table, looking relaxed. Meremiah leans against the counter, watching the water heat, his expression neutral.

**KELLY**
(changing the subject)
So what do you think about this whole wall situation?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(sighing)
We were just talking about that.

**KELLY**
And?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
And... it's weird. But harmless.

**KELLY**
(turning to face them)
I don't think it's weird at all. I think it's sweet, honestly. He's found something that makes him happy.

**MEREMIAH**
(skeptical)
It's a wall, Kelly.

**KELLY**
(defensive)
So? People collect stamps. People build model trains. People get obsessed with sports teams who don't even know they exist. Dan likes a wall. What's the difference?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
The difference is you can do something with stamps and trains. A wall just... sits there. It doesn't do anything.

**KELLY**
(stirring the pasta thoughtfully)
Maybe that's the point. Maybe he likes that it just exists. No pressure, no expectations. It's just there.

**MEREMIAH**
(considering this)
Huh. I guess I never thought about it like that.

**KELLY**
(smiling)
You should try it sometime. Finding something that just makes you happy for no reason.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(curious)
What makes you happy for no reason?

**KELLY**
(grinning)
Food. Obviously.

**MEREMIAH**
(shaking his head)
That's not for no reason. Food keeps you alive. There's a very good reason to like food.

**KELLY**
(correcting herself)
Okay, fine. Good food. Like, really good mac and cheese. The kind that makes you close your eyes when you eat it. The kind that makes you forget about everything else for a minute.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(nodding)
I can respect that.

The water starts to boil. Kelly adds the pasta and stirs it carefully, making sure each piece is separated.

**KELLY**
(checking the box)
How long until this is done?

**MEREMIAH**
(reading over her shoulder)
Says seven to nine minutes.

**KELLY**
(setting a timer on her phone)
Perfect. That gives us time to talk about the real issue.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(wary)
Which is?

**KELLY**
(leaning against the counter)
The fact that nobody in this house can agree on anything. Dan has his wall. You two have your opinions about the wall. Jayson and Joyride think everything's a joke. Charlie and Sunny are just trying to keep everyone from killing each other.

**MEREMIAH**
(shrugging)
Welcome to family life.

**KELLY**
I know, but it's exhausting sometimes. Like, can't we all just exist without constant drama?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(realistic)
Probably not. Drama seems to follow us. Or we create it. Maybe both.

**KELLY**
(sighing)
Yeah. You're right.

They wait as the water boils. The kitchen fills with the sound of the stove and the occasional clink of a pot lid. Steam rises from the pot, fogging up the window above the sink.

**MEREMIAH**
(breaking the silence)
You know what I think the problem is?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(looking up)
What?

**MEREMIAH**
(leaning forward)
We all care too much. About different things, yeah, but we care. And when people care about different things, they clash. It's inevitable.

**KELLY**
(surprised)
That's surprisingly philosophical for you.

**MEREMIAH**
(shrugging)
I have my moments.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(teasing)
Rare moments.

**MEREMIAH**
(agreeing)
Very rare.

**KELLY**
(adding butter to the pot)
But you're right. We do all care. Sometimes I wish we didn't care so much. It would make things easier.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(disagreeing)
Would it though? If nobody cared about anything, what would be the point?

**MEREMIAH**
(considering)
Peace and quiet?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(shaking his head)
No. Just emptiness. There's a difference.

**KELLY**
(pointing at him with the spoon)
See, this is what I'm talking about. We can't even agree on whether caring is good or bad.

They all laugh quietly, the tension breaking. The pasta continues to cook, filling the kitchen with the familiar smell of starch and warmth.

**MEREMIAH**
(after a pause)
Can I ask you something?

**KELLY**
(stirring)
Sure.

**MEREMIAH**
Do you think we're all a little broken?

**KELLY**
(pausing)
What do you mean?

**MEREMIAH**
(elaborating)
Like... Dan needs a wall to feel okay. I don't feel much of anything. You're always eating. Not Jeremiah needs everything to be organized. We all have these... things. These coping mechanisms.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(defending)
That's not broken. That's just being human.

**MEREMIAH**
(persistent)
Is it though? Is it normal to be this attached to things? To need them?

**KELLY**
(thoughtful)
I think... I think everyone needs something. Some people just hide it better.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(agreeing)
And some people's needs are more socially acceptable. Nobody looks at you weird if you like food. But if you like a wall...

**MEREMIAH**
(finishing the thought)
...people think you're crazy.

**KELLY**
(defensive of Dan)
He's not crazy. He's just different.

**MEREMIAH**
(shrugging)
Maybe that's the same thing.

**KELLY**
(firmly)
It's not.

The timer on Kelly's phone goes off. She drains the pasta, the steam rising up around her face, and starts adding the cheese sauce.

**KELLY** (CONT'D)
(stirring)
This is going to be so good.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(watching her)
You say that every time.

**KELLY**
(grinning)
And I'm right every time.

**MEREMIAH**
(almost smiling)
That's actually true. You are.

Kelly dishes out the mac and cheese onto three plates, making sure each serving is generous. She hands one to Not Jeremiah, one to Meremiah, and keeps one for herself.

They all sit down at the table together.

**KELLY**
(taking a bite)
Mmm. Perfect.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(also eating)
Yeah, it is. This is really good, Kelly.

**MEREMIAH**
(nodding while chewing)
Best one yet.

**KELLY**
(pleased)
Thanks. It's all about the cheese-to-pasta ratio.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(curious)
What's the ratio?

**KELLY**
(seriously)
More cheese. Always more cheese.

**MEREMIAH**
(raising his fork)
Words to live by.

They eat in relative silence for a moment, just enjoying the food and each other's company.

**KELLY**
(after a pause)
Do you guys ever wonder what it would be like if we weren't all living together?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(looking up)
Sometimes. Why?

**KELLY**
(putting down her fork)
I don't know. Just thinking. Like, would we still talk to each other? Would we still care about each other's problems?

**MEREMIAH**
(considering)
Probably. Family's family, right?

**KELLY**
(uncertain)
Yeah, but sometimes I feel like we're only close because we're forced to be. Like, if we all lived in different places, would we actually make the effort?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(frowning)
That's dark, Kelly.

**KELLY**
(defensive)
I'm just being honest.

**MEREMIAH**
(surprisingly optimistic)
I think we would. At least some of us. Dan would probably still text me about his wall.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(laughing)
"Hey Meremiah, just wanted to let you know my wall is doing great. Thought you should know."

**KELLY**
(joining in)
"Thanks for the update, Dan. Very important information. My day is now complete."

They all laugh together, the heaviness of the conversation lifting slightly.

**MEREMIAH**
(more serious again)
But seriously, I think we'd stay in touch. We're annoying, but we're not terrible.

**KELLY**
(amending)
Most of the time.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(agreeing)
Most of the time.

They continue eating, the conversation dying down into comfortable silence. The kind of silence that only comes with people who are comfortable with each other.

## INT. NEW HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (PARALLEL SCENE)

Meanwhile, JAYRIDE (17, same kid from the attic, but now looking annoyed and slightly vengeful) comes downstairs looking for something to eat. He spots Meremiah through the kitchen doorway but doesn't want to deal with him right now. He's still embarrassed about getting kicked out of the attic.

He heads to the microwave in the living room corner and starts heating up his own mac and cheese—the cheap, quick version that comes in a mug and has weird orange powder instead of real cheese sauce.

He grabs a fork from a drawer and a drink from the mini fridge nearby and sits on the couch, waiting for his food to finish heating. His phone is in his other hand, scrolling mindlessly.

The TV is on nearby, playing softly. A NEWS ANCHOR (voice only) is talking about something. Jayride isn't paying attention at first—just scrolling through social media, half-watching the screen.

**NEWS ANCHOR** (V.O.)
—escape plan has surfaced online. A prisoner claiming to be affiliated with the suspect known as NCTEJ=7/ has released what appears to be a detailed blueprint for a prison break. The document was forwarded to multiple news outlets earlier this week.

Jayride perks up slightly, looking at the TV now, his phone forgotten.

**NEWS ANCHOR** (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Most experts are dismissing this as a hoax, likely generated by artificial intelligence. However, officials are taking the threat seriously. When asked about the validity of the escape plan, a prison spokesperson stated they are investigating all potential security threats.

The microwave beeps loudly. Jayride pulls out his food, which is steaming hot, and sits back on the couch with his mug of mac and cheese. He watches the TV while eating, his expression skeptical.

**NEWS ANCHOR** (V.O.) (CONT'D)
The question remains: will she attempt the escape? And if so, when? We'll keep you updated as more information comes in.

Jayride shakes his head and takes a bite of his mac and cheese, which is too hot and burns his tongue slightly.

**JAYRIDE**
(to himself, blowing on the food)
This is totally fake. This has to be AI or something. Nobody releases their escape plan to the news.

He calls out toward the kitchen, his voice loud enough to carry.

**JAYRIDE** (CONT'D)
Hey! You guys seeing this?

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Meremiah, Not Jeremiah, and Kelly all turn to look toward the living room where the TV is playing.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(calling back)
What is it?

**JAYRIDE** (O.S.)
They're talking about some escape plan thing. NCTEJ=7/ or whatever. I think it's fake.

Meremiah pushes his chair back and walks over to the doorway where he can see the TV. He watches for a moment, his expression not changing much, but he seems unimpressed.

**MEREMIAH**
(calling to Jayride)
Yeah, that's definitely AI. No way that's real.

**KELLY**
(walking toward the living room)
Should we call someone?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(following)
For what? If it's AI, it doesn't matter.

**JAYRIDE**
(from the couch, talking through a mouthful of food)
That's what I'm saying! Everything's AI now. You can't trust anything you see on the news anymore. They can make videos of anyone saying anything.

**KELLY**
(concerned)
But what if it's not AI? What if it's real?

**JAYRIDE**
(shrugging)
Then we're all screwed anyway. What are we supposed to do about it? Call the prison?

**MEREMIAH**
(walking into the living room)
Nothing. Because it's not real. Trust me.

Meremiah walks over to the TV and watches for another moment. The news segment is still running, showing images of the prison, diagrams that are blurred out, officials making statements.

**KELLY**
You seem pretty confident about that.

**MEREMIAH**
(reaching for the remote)
I am. Trust me, if someone was actually planning to escape from prison, they wouldn't leak it to the news. That's the dumbest thing you could possibly do.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(playing devil's advocate)
Unless it's a distraction.

**MEREMIAH**
(pausing, looking at him)
What?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
I'm just saying. What if the leak is intentional? What if they want everyone to think it's fake so they don't take it seriously? What if the real escape is happening while everyone's dismissing it as AI?

**KELLY**
(considering this)
That's actually kind of smart.

**JAYRIDE**
(also considering)
Huh. I didn't think of that.

**MEREMIAH**
(shaking his head)
Or it's just AI-generated clickbait designed to get views, and we're overthinking it because that's what people do now. Everything's a conspiracy, everything's a distraction, nothing is what it seems. Sometimes things are exactly what they appear to be: fake.

**JAYRIDE**
(raising his mug)
I'm with Meremiah on this one! Occam's Razor. Simplest explanation is usually the right one.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(surprised)
You know Occam's Razor?

**JAYRIDE**
(defensive)
I'm not an idiot. I go to school.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(apologetic)
I didn't mean—

**JAYRIDE**
(cutting him off)
I know. But yeah, simplest explanation: it's fake news. Literally fake news. AI-generated fake news.

**MEREMIAH**
(nodding)
Exactly.

Meremiah walks over and turns off the TV decisively. The sudden silence is almost jarring.

**KELLY**
(protesting weakly)
But what if—

**MEREMIAH**
(walking back toward the kitchen)
No "what ifs." It's fake. Case closed.

He comes back to the kitchen table where Kelly is now dishing out the mac and cheese onto plates, filling each one with generous portions.

**KELLY**
(still uncertain)
I still think we should at least keep an eye on it. Just in case.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(sitting back down)
Keep an eye on what? Fake news?

**KELLY**
(defensive)
Potentially real news that everyone thinks is fake news.

**MEREMIAH**
(sitting down with his plate)
That's paranoia.

**KELLY**
(also sitting)
It's caution.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(mediating)
It's both. And that's okay.

They all sit down at the table, plates in front of them. They start eating again. The TV stays off. The only sound is the occasional clink of forks against plates and quiet chewing.

**KELLY**
(breaking the silence)
This really did turn out good.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(nodding)
Yeah, it did. You've perfected the recipe.

**MEREMIAH**
(eating)
You always make good mac and cheese. It's your gift.

**KELLY**
(pleased)
My gift is making carbs and cheese taste good?

**MEREMIAH**
(seriously)
Everyone needs a gift. That's yours.

**KELLY**
(considering)
I'm okay with that.

They continue eating, the earlier tension about the news completely forgotten. In the living room, Jayride has turned the TV back on, but the news segment is over. It's now showing a commercial for car insurance.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(after a pause)
Do you think Dan's still up in the attic?

**MEREMIAH**
(shrugging)
Probably. He was pretty into that wall.

**KELLY**
Should someone check on him? Make sure he's okay?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(thinking)
Nah. If he's happy up there, let him be happy. He'll come down when he's hungry or when dinner's ready.

**MEREMIAH**
(agreeing)
Yeah. Leave him alone with his wall. Everyone deserves their own space.

**KELLY**
(smiling)
Look at you being all philosophical and understanding.

**MEREMIAH**
(deadpan)
I have layers. Like an onion.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(laughing)
Did you just quote Shrek?

**MEREMIAH**
(serious)
Shrek is a valid philosophical text.

**KELLY**
(also laughing)
I can't tell if you're joking.

**MEREMIAH**
(maintaining his deadpan expression)
Neither can I.

They all laugh together, the sound filling the kitchen with warmth.

The afternoon continues, peaceful and quiet, none of them knowing what the night will bring.

## FADE OUT

## END OF ACT 2

**ESTIMATED RUNTIME: 10-12 minutes**

---

## NOTES FOR PRODUCTION:

- The parallel kitchen/living room scenes should feel natural, not forced
- Meremiah's dismissal of the news as "AI" should feel confident, establishing dramatic irony for Act 6
- Kelly's mac and cheese preparation should feel ritualistic, important to her
- The family dynamic should feel genuine—they tease but care about each other
- The news segment should be played straight, not comedic, to establish real stakes
- Foreshadowing of nighttime events should be subtle
