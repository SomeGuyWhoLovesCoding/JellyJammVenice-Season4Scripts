## INT. NEW HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY (LATER)

Not Jeremiah comes up the stairs and finds Meremiah leaning against the hallway wall. Meremiah looks like he's been waiting there.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Hey. You seen Dan?

**MEREMIAH**
He's probably still up in the attic with that wall of his.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Yeah, what's the deal with that wall anyway? It's just a wall.

**MEREMIAH**
I know. I tried telling him that. He kicked out those two kids—Jayson and Joyride—because they made fun of it.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Seriously? Over a wall?

**MEREMIAH**
Over a wall.

They both stand there for a moment, not really getting it but accepting it anyway.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Anyway, I was going downstairs to get some mac and cheese. You hungry?

**MEREMIAH**
Mac and cheese sounds good. Tell Kelly I'm coming down.

## INT. NEW HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Not Jeremiah and Meremiah head downstairs into the kitchen. The kitchen is bright and clean—one of the few rooms that actually looks organized. Pots and pans are in their places. The fridge is humming quietly.

KELLY (17, always eating, always snacking) is already at the kitchen counter. She's got a box of mac and cheese sitting in front of her, looking like she's about to prepare it.

**KELLY**
Hey, you guys want some? I'm making a big batch.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Yeah, grab me some.

**MEREMIAH**
Make it a lot.

Kelly starts heating up water on the stove. Not Jeremiah pulls out a chair and sits at the kitchen table. Meremiah leans against the counter, watching the water heat.

**KELLY**
This is going to be so good.

They wait as the water boils. The kitchen fills with the sound of the stove and the occasional clink of a pot lid.

## INT. NEW HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (PARALLEL SCENE)

Meanwhile, upstairs, Jayride (17, same kid from the attic, but now looking annoyed) comes downstairs looking for something to eat. He spots Meremiah through the kitchen doorway but doesn't want to deal with him right now.

He heads to the microwave in the living room and starts heating up his own mac and cheese—the cheap, quick version that comes in a mug.

He grabs a fork and a drink from the mini fridge nearby and sits on the couch, waiting for his food to finish heating.

The TV is on nearby. A NEWS ANCHOR (voice only) is talking about something.

**NEWS ANCHOR** (V.O.)
—escape plan has surfaced online. A prisoner claiming to be affiliated with the suspect known as NCTEJ=7/ has released what appears to be—

Jayride perks up slightly, paying attention now.

**NEWS ANCHOR** (V.O.)
—forwarded to multiple news outlets as a hoax. However, officials are taking the threat seriously. When asked about the validity of the escape plan, the newsman stated—

The microwave beeps. Jayride pulls out his food, which is steaming hot. He sits back on the couch with his mug of mac and cheese and watches the TV.

**NEWS ANCHOR** (V.O.)
—will she attempt the escape? And if so, when? We'll keep you updated as more information comes in.

Jayride shakes his head and takes a bite of his mac and cheese.

**JAYRIDE**
(to himself)
This is totally fake. This has to be AI or something.

He calls out toward the kitchen.

**JAYRIDE** (CONT'D)
Hey! You guys seeing this?

## INT. NEW HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Meremiah, Not Jeremiah, and Kelly all turn to look toward the living room where the TV is playing.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
What is it?

**JAYRIDE** (O.S.)
They're talking about some escape plan thing. NCTEJ=7/ or whatever. I think it's fake.

Meremiah walks over to the TV and watches for a moment. His expression doesn't change much, but he seems unimpressed.

**MEREMIAH**
Yeah, that's definitely AI. No way that's real.

**KELLY**
Should we call someone?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
For what? If it's AI, it doesn't matter.

Meremiah walks over and turns off the TV. He comes back to the kitchen table where Kelly is now dishing out the mac and cheese onto plates.

**MEREMIAH**
No point watching that garbage.

They all sit down at the table, plates in front of them. They start eating. The TV stays off. The only sound is the occasional clink of forks against plates and quiet conversation.

**KELLY**
This turned out really good.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Yeah, it did.

They eat in relative silence, none of them really thinking about the news report or NCTEJ=7/ or anything beyond their immediate meal.
