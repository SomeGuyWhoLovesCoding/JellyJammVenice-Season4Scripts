## INT. NEW HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

The living room is a blend of chaos and comfort. Boxes are scattered around with labels like "DISHES," "BOOKS," "FRAGILE - KITCHEN," and "DAN'S STUFF - DO NOT TOUCH." Family photos sit on a side table, not yet hung on the walls, leaning against each other like tired soldiers. The furniture is arranged in a somewhat haphazard way—a couch here, a chair there, an ottoman inexplicably in the middle of the room—as if the family is still figuring out how to make the space work.

Morning light pours through the windows, illuminating dust particles floating lazily through the air. The house has that particular smell of a new place—paint, wood, possibility.

CHARLIE (49, graying hair, wearing a casual sweater with a coffee stain on the sleeve) stands near the kitchen entrance. He leans in close to SUNNY (39, holding a newborn baby wrapped in a soft blue blanket), and whispers something to her—his words are inaudible to us, but his expression is serious, almost concerned.

Sunny listens intently, her brow furrowing slightly. She nods and heads toward the kitchen without question, bouncing the baby gently as she goes, making soft shushing sounds.

Charlie watches her disappear into the other room, then lets out a long breath. He looks tired. Really tired.

**CHARLIE**
(to himself, quietly)
This house is going to be the death of me.

Just as he says this—

DAN (20, perpetually bouncy, always seems to be moving, wearing mismatched socks and a t-shirt that says "I SURVIVED FAT CAILLOU") comes bounding down the hallway like an overgrown puppy. He spots the furniture and immediately becomes fascinated by a drawer beneath an end table.

He jumps on it experimentally. The drawer rattles with his weight, making a concerning creaking sound.

He jumps again. And again. Each time, he grins wider, like he's discovered something amazing.

**DAN**
(to himself, excited)
This is incredible! It's like a trampoline!

NOT JEREMIAH (20, the more measured of the two, wearing a button-up shirt tucked into khakis like someone who actually thinks about his appearance) watches from across the room with visible concern, his arms crossed.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Dan. Don't do that.

DAN bounces once more, completely unbothered, the drawer making an even louder creaking sound.

**DAN**
(still bouncing)
It's fine! These drawers are sturdy! Look how well they're handling my weight!

**NOT JEREMIAH**
They're not, actually. And you're going to break them. Then we're going to have to explain to Charlie why there's a hole in the floor.

**DAN**
(pausing mid-bounce)
There's not going to be a hole in the floor. You're being paranoid.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
I'm being realistic. That drawer is literally bending under your weight right now.

**DAN**
(looking down)
No it's not.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Yes it is. Look at it.

**DAN**
(squinting)
I don't see any bending.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
That's because you're standing on it. Get off and look.

**CHARLIE**
(from across the room, not looking up from his phone)
Listen to your brother, Dan.

**DAN**
(jumping off the drawer, looking at Not Jeremiah)
He's not my brother. We just have similar names.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(sighing)
We've been over this. We're basically brothers.

**DAN**
(grinning mischievously)
Basically doesn't count. Basically is like saying "I'm basically a millionaire" when you have seventeen dollars.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
That's not the same thing at all.

**DAN**
It absolutely is. Basically means "not actually." Therefore, you're basically not my brother, which means you're not my brother.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(frustrated)
We've lived together for three years!

**DAN**
And I've lived in Pennsylvania my whole life, but that doesn't make me basically a Founding Father.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(pinching the bridge of his nose)
That... that doesn't even make sense.

**DAN**
Sure it does. Proximity doesn't equal relationship.

**CHARLIE**
(finally looking up)
Boys. The furniture. Can we focus on not destroying the house on day three?

**DAN**
(defensively)
I wasn't destroying anything! I was testing structural integrity!

**CHARLIE**
By jumping on it?

**DAN**
That's how you test things! You apply pressure and see what happens!

**CHARLIE**
That's not how—you know what, never mind. Just don't break anything.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
I'm trying to stop him from breaking things, but he doesn't listen to me.

**DAN**
That's because you're not my supervisor.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
I'm literally in charge when Charlie's not here.

**DAN**
You're "basically" in charge, which means you're not actually in charge.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(turning to Charlie)
Do you see what I have to deal with?

**CHARLIE**
Every day. Trust me, I see it every day.

DAN ignores them both and spots the staircase. Without any transition, his interest shifts completely—like a dog spotting a squirrel. He bounds toward it, his movements exaggerated and full of energy.

**DAN**
(calling back as he runs)
I'm going upstairs!

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(calling after him)
Don't break anything up there either!

**DAN**
(already halfway up the stairs)
No promises!

**CHARLIE**
(to Not Jeremiah, wearily)
Go with him. Make sure he doesn't destroy the second floor.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(heading toward the stairs)
Why is that my job?

**CHARLIE**
(looking at him seriously)
Because you're the only one who can keep up with him. And because I trust you.

NOT JEREMIAH pauses on the stairs, looking back at Charlie. There's something significant about that statement—the trust, the responsibility.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(quietly)
I know. That's why I do it.

**CHARLIE**
(nodding)
I know you do. And I appreciate it. Even if he drives you crazy.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
He does. Every single day.

**CHARLIE**
(smiling slightly)
That's Dan for you.

NOT JEREMIAH nods and continues up the stairs at a much slower, more measured pace than Dan's frantic bounding.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Dan reaches the top of the stairs, breathing a little harder than he was downstairs. He stops and looks around, his eyes wide with excitement.

The hallway is long, with doors on both sides. Some are open, revealing partially unpacked rooms. Some are closed, mysterious.

**DAN**
(to himself, his voice filled with wonder)
So many rooms. So many possibilities. This house is like a maze. A beautiful, unexplored maze.

He walks toward one of the doors, his hand reaching out for the doorknob. He's about to knock when it opens on its own.

MEREMIAH (21, withdrawn, moving slowly like he's underwater, wearing the same clothes he's probably been wearing for two days) stands in the doorway. One eye is more open than the other, giving him a perpetually tired appearance—like he's permanently half-asleep. His hair is messy, sticking up in odd directions.

He sees Dan and the light in his eyes doesn't change. No recognition, no interest, no emotion.

DAN, not noticing or not caring about Meremiah's complete lack of enthusiasm, launches immediately into speech, words tumbling over each other like an avalanche.

**DAN**
Meremiah! Oh man, I'm so glad you're here! Have you heard about Fat Caillou? Five hundred and six thousand pounds! Five hundred and six thousand! That's the biggest person ever recorded in history! Can you imagine? I was reading about it last night and I couldn't sleep because I kept thinking about it and—

MEREMIAH stares at him with the expression of someone listening to a television in another room—present but not engaged, aware but not interested.

**MEREMIAH**
(flatly)
No.

**DAN**
(not deterred at all)
—and it's just absolutely wild! Like, that's more than a thousand people combined! A thousand average-sized people! And there's this whole documentary about how they had to reinforce the floors in his house because the normal floors couldn't support the weight and they had to bring in engineers and—

**MEREMIAH**
(interrupting)
Dan.

**DAN**
(pausing)
Yeah?

**MEREMIAH**
(his voice completely devoid of emotion)
I don't care.

**DAN**
(blinking)
About... about Fat Caillou?

**MEREMIAH**
About any of it. I don't care about Fat Caillou, I don't care about the structural engineering of his house, I don't care about the documentary.

**DAN**
(deflating slightly)
Oh. Okay. But hear me out—the medical implications alone are fascinating because they had to develop entirely new equipment just to—

**MEREMIAH**
(holding up one hand)
Dan. Stop.

**DAN**
(stopping mid-sentence)
What?

**MEREMIAH**
I said I don't care. That means stop talking about it.

**DAN**
But it's really interesting!

**MEREMIAH**
Not to me.

**DAN**
How can you not find this interesting? It's literally the most extreme example of human biological capacity we've ever—

**MEREMIAH**
(more forcefully)
Dan.

**DAN**
(finally getting it)
Right. Okay. You don't care. Got it.

There's an awkward pause. Dan shuffles his feet. Meremiah just stares at him.

**DAN** (CONT'D)
So... what do you care about?

**MEREMIAH**
(thinking for a moment)
Sleep. Quiet. Being left alone.

**DAN**
(trying again)
Okay, but besides that—

**MEREMIAH**
(cutting him off)
That's it. That's the whole list.

**DAN**
That's kind of depressing.

**MEREMIAH**
(shrugging)
It's honest.

**DAN**
Don't you have any hobbies? Any interests?

**MEREMIAH**
No.

**DAN**
Nothing?

**MEREMIAH**
Nothing.

**DAN**
What about—

MEREMIAH, without warning and without explanation, reaches out and gently nudges Dan to the side. He doesn't say anything. He just moves past him, his movements slow and deliberate, and heads toward the attic stairs at the end of the hallway.

**DAN**
(calling after him)
Where are you going?

**MEREMIAH**
(over his shoulder, not stopping)
To check on something.

**DAN**
(following a few steps)
Check on what?

**MEREMIAH**
(already at the attic stairs)
None of your business.

**DAN**
(more curious now)
Why won't you tell me?

**MEREMIAH**
(pausing at the bottom of the attic stairs, turning to look at Dan)
Because if I tell you, then you'll want to come with me. And I don't want you to come with me.

**DAN**
Why not?

**MEREMIAH**
(sighing)
Because you talk too much. You ask too many questions. You have too much energy. And I need peace and quiet.

**DAN**
I can be quiet!

**MEREMIAH**
No you can't.

**DAN**
Yes I can! Watch!

Dan makes an exaggerated motion of zipping his lips and throwing away an imaginary key.

**MEREMIAH**
(staring at him)
You just proved my point. You can't even be quiet about being quiet.

**DAN**
(making muffled sounds through his "zipped" lips)
Mmmmph mmph!

**MEREMIAH**
(turning away)
I'm leaving now.

He starts climbing the attic stairs, leaving Dan in the hallway.

Dan stops mid-sentence, his enthusiasm deflating like a balloon. His shoulders slump. His expression falls.

NOT JEREMIAH appears at the top of the main stairs and winces sympathetically, having witnessed the whole interaction.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(walking over to Dan)
Don't take it personally. He's like that with everyone.

**DAN**
(quietly, looking down)
Nobody cares about Fat Caillou anymore.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(putting a hand on Dan's shoulder)
I care about Fat Caillou.

**DAN**
(looking up hopefully)
Really?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(pausing)
No. Not even a little bit. But I appreciate your enthusiasm about it.

**DAN**
(his face brightening)
That's good enough!

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Is it though?

**DAN**
(grinning)
Yeah! Appreciation of enthusiasm is basically the same as sharing the enthusiasm!

**NOT JEREMIAH**
That's not how that works.

**DAN**
Sure it is! It's like... it's like if I'm excited about pizza, and you're excited that I'm excited about pizza, then we're both excited about pizza!

**NOT JEREMIAH**
But I'm not excited about the pizza itself.

**DAN**
But you're excited about something related to pizza, which is basically the same thing.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(shaking his head)
Your logic is deeply flawed.

**DAN**
(already moving on)
Anyway, I'm going to see what Meremiah's checking on!

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(following)
He said it was none of your business.

**DAN**
Exactly! Which means it's definitely my business!

**NOT JEREMIAH**
That's literally the opposite of what he said.

**DAN**
(heading toward the attic stairs)
When people say things are none of your business, it means they're hiding something interesting!

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Or it means they want privacy.

**DAN**
(calling back)
Same thing!

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(following reluctantly)
It's really not. Dan, where are you going?

**DAN**
To the attic! To discover the mystery!

**NOT JEREMIAH**
There's no mystery. He's probably just checking to make sure nothing got broken during the move.

**DAN**
Or he's hiding something amazing up there!

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(sighing)
Why do I even bother?

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS

Dan climbs the narrow stairs with his characteristic enthusiasm, taking them two at a time. Each step creaks slightly under his weight. The staircase is cramped, with walls pressing in on either side, and the ceiling gets lower as he climbs.

**DAN**
(to himself, his voice echoing in the stairwell)
These stairs are so creaky. Like a haunted house. Maybe this attic is haunted. Maybe Meremiah is going up to commune with ghosts. Maybe he's secretly a ghost medium and that's why he's so withdrawn—he's actually listening to ghost conversations all day!

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(from behind him, his voice flat)
It's an old house. Everything creaks. There are no ghosts.

**DAN**
(looking back)
That's what they want you to think. The ghosts, I mean. They want you to think they're not real, so you let your guard down.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
There. Are. No. Ghosts.

**DAN**
(turning back to climbing)
That's exactly what someone haunted by ghosts would say. The ghosts are probably controlling you right now, making you deny their existence!

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(pinching the bridge of his nose)
I'm not being controlled by ghosts.

**DAN**
That's what the ghosts would make you say!

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Dan, I swear to God—

**DAN**
(interrupting)
See? You're swearing to God because the ghosts are afraid of divine intervention!

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(giving up)
You know what? Fine. The house is haunted. I'm possessed. Meremiah is a ghost medium. Whatever helps you sleep at night.

**DAN**
(reaching the top of the stairs)
I knew it!

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

Dan emerges into the attic, and he stops, his eyes going wide.

It's cluttered—boxes stacked haphazardly reaching toward the ceiling, old furniture covered with white sheets like sleeping ghosts, random items from previous owners collecting dust in corners. Light filters through a glass ceiling in the center of the attic, creating dramatic beams of light cutting through the dusty air.

**DAN**
(whispered, awed)
Whoa. This place is like a time capsule. Like someone just... left their whole life up here.

Meremiah is already there, standing near a specific wall on the far side of the attic, directly under the glass ceiling. His hand is resting on it gently, almost reverently.

Dan navigates through the mess with surprising purpose, stepping carefully around obstacles—a broken lamp here, a stack of old magazines there, a box labeled "CHRISTMAS 1987."

**DAN** (CONT'D)
(calling out to Meremiah)
What are you doing?

**MEREMIAH**
(not looking at him, his voice soft)
Making sure it's okay.

**DAN**
(getting closer)
Making sure what's okay?

**MEREMIAH**
(still not looking)
The wall.

Dan reaches Meremiah and looks at the wall. Just a regular wall. Nothing extraordinary about it. Plain white drywall, perfectly smooth, unmarked. Just... a wall.

**DAN**
(confused)
What about the wall?

**MEREMIAH**
(finally turning to look at him)
It's important.

**DAN**
(looking at the wall more closely)
Why? What makes it important?

**MEREMIAH**
(pausing, considering)
Because it is.

**DAN**
(frustrated)
That's not an answer. What makes it important? Is there something behind it? Is it load-bearing? Does it have historical significance?

**MEREMIAH**
(shaking his head)
No. It's just... important.

**DAN**
But why?

**MEREMIAH**
(stepping aside)
You'll understand eventually. Or you won't. Either way, it doesn't really matter.

**DAN**
(more insistent)
No, tell me. I want to understand. What makes this wall different from all the other walls?

**MEREMIAH**
(looking at the wall again)
It's perfect.

**DAN**
Perfect how?

**MEREMIAH**
Just... perfect. Look at it.

Dan looks. He really looks this time, trying to see what Meremiah sees.

**DAN**
(slowly)
It's very white.

**MEREMIAH**
Exactly.

**DAN**
And smooth.

**MEREMIAH**
Yes.

**DAN**
And... clean?

**MEREMIAH**
(nodding)
No marks. No scratches. No imperfections. Just white. Just smooth. Just... there.

**DAN**
(something shifting in his understanding)
Just there.

**MEREMIAH**
(looking at Dan now)
Do you get it?

**DAN**
(still staring at the wall)
I... I think so. It doesn't want anything from you.

**MEREMIAH**
(the first hint of emotion in his voice)
Exactly. It just exists. It doesn't need me to do anything. It doesn't expect anything. It just... is.

**DAN**
(stepping closer to the wall)
Can I touch it?

**MEREMIAH**
(hesitating)
Be gentle.

**DAN**
(reaching out slowly)
I will.

Dan places his hand on the wall gently, reverently. He runs his hand along the surface, checking. Looking. Feeling.

The texture is perfect. The paint is smooth. There are no marks, no scratches, no imperfections. Just perfect white drywall.

**DAN**
(quietly, wonderingly)
Oh. I get it now.

**MEREMIAH**
(almost smiling)
Do you?

**DAN**
(not turning around, his hand still on the wall)
Yeah. It's like... it's like everything else in life is complicated and demanding and unpredictable. But this wall... this wall is just simple. Just perfect. Just... peaceful.

**MEREMIAH**
(nodding)
Yes.

**DAN**
(his voice getting softer)
Everything else wants something from you. People want you to be interesting or funny or helpful or quiet or energetic or calm. They want you to be different than you are. But this wall...

**MEREMIAH**
(finishing the thought)
...doesn't want anything.

**DAN**
(turning to look at Meremiah)
Can it be mine too?

**MEREMIAH**
(considering)
What do you mean?

**DAN**
Can we share it? Can it be our wall?

**MEREMIAH**
(shaking his head)
No. It's mine. But you can visit it. If you're respectful.

**DAN**
(disappointed)
Oh.

**MEREMIAH**
(walking toward the stairs)
I'm going back downstairs now. You can stay if you want. Just don't touch it too much.

**DAN**
(calling after him)
Wait, why can't we share it?

**MEREMIAH**
(pausing at the stairs)
Because if we share it, then it becomes about us. About our relationship to each other. And then it's not just the wall anymore. It becomes complicated.

**DAN**
(understanding)
Oh.

**MEREMIAH**
(starting down the stairs)
But like I said. You can visit.

Meremiah disappears down the stairs, leaving Dan alone.

NOT JEREMIAH walks over and looks at the wall, trying to see what Dan and Meremiah see.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(confused)
I don't understand.

**DAN**
(not turning around, his hand still on the wall)
You don't have to. It's okay.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
But it's just a wall. It's just drywall and paint.

**DAN**
(finally turning to look at him)
No. It's THE wall.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(looking between Dan and the wall)
What does that even mean?

**DAN**
(struggling to explain)
It means... it means it's perfect. And it's simple. And it's mine. Well, Meremiah's. But I can visit it.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(slowly)
You're getting attached to a wall.

**DAN**
(defensively)
So what if I am?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
It's just... it's a little weird, Dan.

**DAN**
(his voice rising)
Why is it weird? People get attached to things all the time! People collect stamps and coins and baseball cards and comic books! How is this different?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Because you can do something with those things. You can organize them, trade them, display them. But a wall just... sits there.

**DAN**
(turning back to the wall)
Maybe that's the point. Maybe I don't want something I have to do things with. Maybe I just want something that just... is.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(backing away slowly)
Alright. Well. I'm going to go back downstairs now.

**DAN**
(still staring at the wall)
Okay.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Are you coming?

**DAN**
(shaking his head)
Not yet. I want to stay a little longer.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(concerned)
Don't stay up here too long. It's dusty and you have allergies.

**DAN**
(waving him off)
I'll be fine.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(heading toward the stairs)
I'm serious, Dan. Don't spend all day up here.

**DAN**
(not listening)
Uh-huh.

Not Jeremiah leaves, shaking his head. Dan stays, his hand still on the wall, his expression peaceful for the first time since we've seen him.

**DAN** (CONT'D)
(quietly, to the wall)
You're perfect. You know that? You're absolutely perfect.

He stands there for a long moment, just appreciating it.

Then—

Suddenly, loud voices and laughing echo up the staircase, shattering the peace.

**JAYSON** (O.S.)
(laughing loudly)
I'm telling you, it's up here!

**JOYRIDE** (O.S.)
(also laughing)
This better be good! You said there was something weird!

Dan's entire demeanor changes. His body goes rigid. His peaceful expression vanishes, replaced by something harder, more protective.

JAYSON (15, loud, thinks everything is a joke, wearing a basketball jersey that's two sizes too big) and JOYRIDE (17, perpetually smirking, wearing a backwards baseball cap) emerge into the attic, still laughing about something between them. They're clearly in the middle of some inside joke, shoving each other playfully.

They see Dan by his wall and exchange grins—the kind of grins that say they've found something to make fun of.

**JOYRIDE**
(pointing)
Yo, what's up with this wall? Is this like his thing?

**JAYSON**
(laughing harder now)
Dude, is he just... standing there? Staring at a wall?

**JOYRIDE**
(walking closer)
That's weird, man. That's really weird.

**DAN**
(his voice low and warning)
What are you doing up here?

**JOYRIDE**
(shrugging)
Just exploring, man. Chill out. It's a free country.

**JAYSON**
(getting closer to the wall)
What's so special about this wall anyway? It's just drywall. My house has like fifty of these.

**DAN**
(stepping between them and the wall)
Don't touch it.

**JAYSON**
(grinning, reaching out)
Why? What's going to happen if I—

**DAN**
(his voice sharp and commanding)
I said don't touch it.

They both stop, surprised by the intensity in his voice. They're not used to Dan being serious. Dan is the bouncy, enthusiastic one. Dan is the one who talks about Fat Caillou. This version of Dan is new.

**JOYRIDE**
(trying to play it off)
Whoa, okay. We're not touching your precious wall.

**JAYSON**
(laughing nervously)
Yeah, relax, man. We were just kidding around.

But they don't leave. They stand there, looking at Dan, looking at the wall, trying to figure out what the big deal is.

**JAYSON** (CONT'D)
(genuinely curious now)
But seriously, what's the deal? Why do you care about this wall so much?

**DAN**
(his voice still hard)
That's none of your business.

**JOYRIDE**
(smirking)
Come on, man. It's just a wall. It's paint and drywall and studs.

**JAYSON**
(joining in)
Yeah, what are you, in love with it or something?

They both laugh at their own joke—the kind of teenage boy laughter that's designed to make someone else feel small.

Dan's entire body tenses even more. His hands clench into fists. His face flushes red.

**DAN**
(quietly, dangerously)
Get out.

The laughter stops immediately.

**JAYSON**
(confused)
What?

**DAN**
(louder now)
Get out. Now.

**JOYRIDE**
(defensive)
Dude, we were just—

**DAN**
(shouting)
GET OUT!

There's no room for argument in his voice. He moves toward them with actual purpose, and his expression says he means it. He's not joking. He's not playing around. He's serious, and they can see it in his eyes.

**JAYSON**
(backing up)
Whoa, okay—

**JOYRIDE**
(also backing up)
We're going, we're going!

Dan firmly but not aggressively guides them both toward the attic stairs, physically placing himself between them and the wall like a guard dog.

**JOYRIDE** (CONT'D)
(as they're being pushed toward the stairs)
What's the big deal, man? It's just a wall!

**DAN**
(his voice cold)
Just go.

**JAYSON**
(backing down the stairs, his bravado returning now that he's at a safe distance)
You're crazy, you know that? You're actually crazy.

**JOYRIDE**
(joining in)
Yeah, who gets this worked up about a wall? It's not normal, dude.

**DAN**
Maybe. But this is my attic. And that's my wall. So leave.

**JAYSON**
(from the staircase, trying to save face)
Whatever, man. We didn't want to be up here anyway. It smells weird.

**JOYRIDE**
(also from the staircase)
Yeah, it smells like crazy person.

**DAN**
(stepping toward the stairs)
You know what? I'm going to tell Charlie about this.

**JAYSON**
(suddenly worried)
About what? We didn't do anything!

**DAN**
You came into a space you weren't invited to. You mocked something that's important to me. And you refused to leave when I asked.

**JOYRIDE**
(defensive)
We're leaving now!

**DAN**
Too late. I'm still telling Charlie.

**JAYSON**
(from the bottom of the stairs now)
That's not fair!

**DAN**
Life's not fair. Get used to it.

Their footsteps fade down the stairs, and Dan can hear them complaining to each other as they go.

**JAYSON** (O.S.)
(fading)
He's insane...

**JOYRIDE** (O.S.)
(also fading)
Totally insane...

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

Dan immediately turns back to his wall. He inspects it methodically, his hand moving across every inch of the surface. He's checking for anything—smudges, handprints, any sign that someone touched it.

**DAN**
(to himself, anxiously)
Did they touch you? Did they get close enough to touch you?

The wall looks exactly as it did before. Perfect. Pristine. Untouched.

**DAN** (CONT'D)
(relieved, speaking to the wall)
No. You're okay. You're still perfect.

Dan takes a deep breath and steps back, still looking at it, making sure.

**DAN** (CONT'D)
(more to himself now)
I need to protect you. I need to make sure nobody else comes up here and messes with you.

He looks around the attic, considering options. Maybe he could move some boxes to create a barrier. Maybe he could put up a sign.

**DAN** (CONT'D)
(deciding)
I'll talk to Charlie. I'll make sure nobody comes up here without permission.

His expression is different now than it was when he was bouncing on drawers downstairs. There's something protective in the way he stands, the way he looks at this wall. Like it matters in a way he can't quite explain to anyone else—and maybe doesn't want to.

Like it's become something more than just a wall. Like it's become his wall.

He reaches out and touches the wall one more time, almost like a goodbye, almost like a promise.

**DAN** (CONT'D)
(quietly, to the wall)
I'll be back. I promise. And I won't let anyone hurt you.

He takes one last look—committing every detail to memory, the perfect whiteness, the smooth surface, the way the light from the glass ceiling makes it almost glow.

Then he turns and heads back toward the staircase, his mind already planning, already strategizing how to keep his wall safe.

**ESTIMATED RUNTIME: 12-14 minutes**

## NOTES FOR PRODUCTION:

- Dan's transformation from bouncy/chaotic to protective/serious should be gradual but clear
- The wall should be filmed in a way that makes it seem special, even though it's just a wall (lighting, framing, camera movement)
- Meremiah's detachment should feel genuine, not comedic
- The confrontation with Jayson/Joyride should establish stakes for later acts
- Music should shift from light/quirky to more contemplative during wall scenes
