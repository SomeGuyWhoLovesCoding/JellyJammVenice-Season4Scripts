## INT. NEW HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY (LATER)

Not Jeremiah comes up the stairs and finds Meremiah leaning against the hallway wall. Meremiah looks like he's been waiting there.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
Get over here. Right now.

Jayride and Jayson slowly emerge from the shadows. They both look guilty, but there's also something defiant in their expressions.

**JAYRIDE**
We didn't mean for it to get this bad.

**DAN**
(turning to face them, tears still streaming)
You didn't mean for it to get this bad? LOOK AT IT! Look at what you did!

**JAYSON**
It's just a wall, man. We can clean it.

**DAN**
(voice rising)
It's not just a wall! It was MY wall! It was the one thing in this entire house that was mine! The one thing nobody else cared about, the one thing that was perfect and untouched and MINE!

**KELLY**
(quietly to Not Jeremiah)
I've never seen him like this.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(quietly back)
Neither have I.

**DAN**
(still shouting)
Do you have any idea what this meant to me? Any idea at all?

**JAYRIDE**
(defensive)
No! No, we don't! Because it's insane! It's a wall! It's paint and drywall! It's not a person! It's not even a thing that matters!

**DAN**
It mattered to me!

**JAYSON**
Well maybe you need to get your priorities straight then. Maybe you need to care about something real instead of a stupid wall.

Dan lunges at Jayson, but Not Jeremiah catches him.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(holding Dan back)
Stop! Dan, stop!

**DAN**
(struggling)
Let me go! Let me—

**NOT JEREMIAH**
No! This isn't going to help!

Dan stops struggling, but he's still shaking with anger and grief.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(to Jayride and Jayson)
You two. Explain. Right now. Why did you do this?

**JAYRIDE**
(looking down)
Because... because we were bored. And angry. And it seemed like fun at the time.

**KELLY**
Fun? You thought destroying someone's property was fun?

**JAYSON**
It's not property. It's a wall. In a house we all live in. It belongs to all of us.

**DAN**
(quietly, dangerously)
No. It was mine. And you knew that.

**MEREMIAH**
(from near the stairs, still in pain)
They took pictures too. I saw them. They were documenting it.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(turning to them)
Is that true?

Jayride and Jayson exchange glances.

**JAYSON**
Yeah. We took some pictures.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Why would you do that?

**JAYRIDE**
We thought... we thought it would be funny to look back on. Like a memory.

**DAN**
A memory. You wanted to remember the time you destroyed something I loved.

**JAYSON**
We didn't know you loved it that much! We thought it was just a weird obsession!

**DAN**
(crying again)
This was my wall. This was the only thing I had.

Not Jeremiah walks over to Dan and puts his hand on his shoulder.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Hey. Hey, look at me. Look at me.

Dan looks up at him, tears streaming down his face.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
Your obsession with this wall doesn't define you. You know that, right?

**DAN**
(shaking his head)
You don't understand. Nobody understands.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Then help me understand. Why is this wall so important?

**DAN**
(voice breaking)
Because it's the only thing that was just mine. Everything else in my life is shared. My room, my stuff, my time. Everyone always wants something from me. But this wall... this wall didn't want anything. It just existed. And it was perfect. And it was mine.

**KELLY**
(softly)
Dan...

**DAN**
And they took that from me. They took the one thing that gave me peace and they ruined it.

There's a long silence. Nobody knows what to say.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(finally)
I know. But we can fix it. We're going to make them clean it up. And then it's going to be okay.

**DAN**
It won't be the same. It'll never be the same.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Maybe not. But it'll still be yours.

Dan wipes his eyes and nods, though he doesn't look convinced.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(to Jayride and Jayson)
You two. You're going to clean this up. Every inch of it. And while you do, we're going to draw a line here. A square around this wall. And if you ever erase that line, if you ever touch it, you're going to be punished twice as long. Do you understand?

**JAYRIDE**
(quietly)
Yeah. We understand.

**JAYSON**
(quietly)
We're sorry.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
I don't want to hear it. Just clean it up.

**KELLY**
(to Not Jeremiah)
What about their phones? They took pictures.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Good point. Hand them over.

**JAYRIDE**
What?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Your phones. Give them to me. Right now.

Reluctantly, Jayride hands over his phone. Jayson hesitates.

**JAYSON**
I need my phone for—

**NOT JEREMIAH**
I don't care. Hand it over.

Jayson slowly pulls his phone from his pocket and gives it to Not Jeremiah.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
We'll deal with these later. Right now, you clean.

Dan walks over to the wall and points to where he wants the square drawn. Not Jeremiah takes a marker and carefully draws a square around the wall, marking its boundaries.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
This is it. This is the line. You don't cross it. Ever.

**DAN**
(watching the line being drawn)
Make it bigger. Give it more space.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
How much bigger?

**DAN**
At least two feet on each side. I don't want anyone coming close to it.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(adjusting the square)
Like this?

**DAN**
Yeah. That's good.

Jayride and Jayson nod and start cleaning up the mess they made, finding cleaning supplies from a corner of the attic.

**JAYRIDE**
(quietly to Jayson while cleaning)
This is going to take hours.

**JAYSON**
(quietly back)
I know.

**JAYRIDE**
Do you think they'll ever forgive us?

**JAYSON**
(looking at Dan, who's watching them intensely)
I don't know. Would you?

**JAYRIDE**
Probably not.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC - LATER

Jayride and Jayson are scrubbing the wall down, trying to clean it as best they can. Dan watches them intensely, making sure they don't miss a spot. Kelly has left to go back downstairs. Meremiah is sitting on a box, holding a cold compress to his eyes.

**DAN**
(to Jayride)
You missed a spot. Right there.

**JAYRIDE**
(looking)
Where?

**DAN**
Right there. The corner. There's still marker.

Jayride scrubs harder at the corner.

**JAYSON**
(to Jayride)
Is it coming off?

**JAYRIDE**
Barely. This stuff is really stuck on here.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Good. That's what you get for using permanent marker.

**JAYSON**
We didn't think—

**NOT JEREMIAH**
That's right. You didn't think. That's the problem.

Water spills and accidentally washes over the line that was drawn, but Dan nods.

**DAN**
That's okay. As long as you don't erase the corners.

**JAYRIDE**
We won't. I promise.

They keep cleaning.

---

## FADE OUT

## END OF ACT 4
Hey. You seen Dan?

**MEREMIAH**
He's probably still up in the attic with that wall of his.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Yeah, what's the deal with that wall anyway? It's just a wall.

**MEREMIAH**
I know. I tried telling him that. He kicked out those two kids—Jayson and Joyride—because they made fun of it.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Seriously? Over a wall?

**MEREMIAH**
Over a wall.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(shaking his head)
That's... I mean, I get having preferences, but a wall? Like, what makes it so special?

**MEREMIAH**
I asked him once. He said it's the only thing in this house that's completely his. Nobody else cares about it, so it's pure. Untouched.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
That's kind of sad when you think about it.

**MEREMIAH**
Yeah. But also kind of weird. It's literally just drywall and paint.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Did you try to explain that to him?

**MEREMIAH**
Multiple times. He doesn't want to hear it. Says I wouldn't understand because I don't have anything I care about that much.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Do you?

**MEREMIAH**
(pausing)
I don't know. Maybe not. Maybe that's the problem.

They both stand there for a moment, not really getting it but accepting it anyway.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Anyway, I was going downstairs to get some mac and cheese. You hungry?

**MEREMIAH**
Mac and cheese sounds good. Tell Kelly I'm coming down.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
She's probably already cooking it. You know how she is.

**MEREMIAH**
Always eating.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Always.

They start heading down the stairs together.

**MEREMIAH**
You think we should check on Dan? Make sure he's okay up there?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Nah. Let him have his moment with the wall. He'll come down when he's ready.

**MEREMIAH**
Fair enough.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Not Jeremiah and Meremiah head downstairs into the kitchen. The kitchen is bright and clean—one of the few rooms that actually looks organized. Pots and pans are in their places. The fridge is humming quietly.

KELLY (17, always eating, always snacking) is already at the kitchen counter. She's got a box of mac and cheese sitting in front of her, looking like she's about to prepare it.

**KELLY**
Hey, you guys want some? I'm making a big batch.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Yeah, grab me some.

**MEREMIAH**
Make it a lot.

**KELLY**
(pouring pasta into the pot)
When do I ever make a small batch?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
True. Remember when you made mac and cheese for like fifteen people and there were only six of us?

**KELLY**
That was one time! And we ate all of it eventually.

**MEREMIAH**
Over three days.

**KELLY**
Still counts.

Kelly starts heating up water on the stove. Not Jeremiah pulls out a chair and sits at the kitchen table. Meremiah leans against the counter, watching the water heat.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
So what do you think about this whole wall situation?

**KELLY**
With Dan? I think it's sweet, honestly. He's found something that makes him happy.

**MEREMIAH**
It's a wall, Kelly.

**KELLY**
So? People collect stamps. People build model trains. Dan likes a wall. What's the difference?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
The difference is you can do something with stamps and trains. A wall just... sits there.

**KELLY**
Maybe that's the point. Maybe he likes that it just exists. No pressure, no expectations. It's just there.

**MEREMIAH**
(considering this)
Huh. I guess I never thought about it like that.

**KELLY**
You should try it sometime. Finding something that just makes you happy for no reason.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
What makes you happy for no reason?

**KELLY**
(grinning)
Food. Obviously.

**MEREMIAH**
That's not for no reason. Food keeps you alive.

**KELLY**
Okay, fine. Good food. Like, really good mac and cheese. The kind that makes you close your eyes when you eat it.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
I can respect that.

The water starts to boil. Kelly adds the pasta and stirs it.

**KELLY**
How long until this is done?

**MEREMIAH**
(checking the box)
Says seven to nine minutes.

**KELLY**
Perfect. That gives us time to talk about the real issue.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Which is?

**KELLY**
The fact that nobody in this house can agree on anything. Dan has his wall. You two have your opinions about the wall. Jayson and Joyride think everything's a joke. Charlie and Sunny are just trying to keep everyone from killing each other.

**MEREMIAH**
Welcome to family life.

**KELLY**
I know, but it's exhausting sometimes. Like, can't we all just exist without constant drama?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Probably not. Drama seems to follow us.

**KELLY**
(sighing)
Yeah. You're right.

They wait as the water boils. The kitchen fills with the sound of the stove and the occasional clink of a pot lid.

**MEREMIAH**
You know what I think the problem is?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
What?

**MEREMIAH**
We all care too much. About different things, yeah, but we care. And when people care, they clash.

**KELLY**
That's surprisingly philosophical for you.

**MEREMIAH**
I have my moments.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Rare moments.

**MEREMIAH**
Very rare.

They all laugh quietly. The pasta continues to cook.

**KELLY**
This is going to be so good.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (PARALLEL SCENE)

Meanwhile, JOYRIDE (17, same kid from the attic, but now looking annoyed) comes downstairs looking for something to eat. He spots Meremiah through the kitchen doorway but doesn't want to deal with him right now.

He heads to the microwave in the living room and starts heating up his own mac and cheese—the cheap, quick version that comes in a mug.

He grabs a fork and a drink from the mini fridge nearby and sits on the couch, waiting for his food to finish heating.

The TV is on nearby. A NEWS ANCHOR (voice only) is talking about something.

**NEWS ANCHOR** (V.O.)
—escape plan has surfaced online. A prisoner claiming to be affiliated with the suspect known as NCTEJ=7/ has released what appears to be—

Joyride perks up slightly, paying attention now.

**NEWS ANCHOR** (V.O.)
—forwarded to multiple news outlets as a hoax. However, officials are taking the threat seriously. When asked about the validity of the escape plan, a prison spokesperson stated—

The microwave beeps. Joyride pulls out his food, which is steaming hot. He sits back on the couch with his mug of mac and cheese and watches the TV.

**NEWS ANCHOR** (V.O.)
—will she attempt the escape? And if so, when? We'll keep you updated as more information comes in.

Joyride shakes his head and takes a bite of his mac and cheese.

**JOYRIDE**
(to himself)
This is totally fake. This has to be AI or something.

He calls out toward the kitchen.

**JOYRIDE** (CONT'D)
Hey! You guys seeing this?

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Meremiah, Not Jeremiah, and Kelly all turn to look toward the living room where the TV is playing.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
What is it?

**JOYRIDE** (O.S.)
They're talking about some escape plan thing. NCTEJ=7/ or whatever. I think it's fake.

Meremiah walks over to the TV and watches for a moment. His expression doesn't change much, but he seems unimpressed.

**MEREMIAH**
Yeah, that's definitely AI. No way that's real.

**KELLY**
Should we call someone?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
For what? If it's AI, it doesn't matter.

**JOYRIDE**
(from the living room)
That's what I'm saying! Everything's AI now. You can't trust anything you see on the news anymore.

**KELLY**
(walking toward the living room)
But what if it's not AI? What if it's real?

**JOYRIDE**
Then we're all screwed anyway. What are we supposed to do about it?

**MEREMIAH**
Nothing. Because it's not real.

Meremiah walks over and turns off the TV. He comes back to the kitchen table where Kelly is now dishing out the mac and cheese onto plates.

**KELLY**
You seem pretty confident about that.

**MEREMIAH**
I am. Trust me, if someone was actually planning to escape from prison, they wouldn't leak it to the news. That's the dumbest thing you could possibly do.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Unless it's a distraction.

**MEREMIAH**
(pausing)
What?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
I'm just saying. What if the leak is intentional? What if they want everyone to think it's fake so they don't take it seriously?

**KELLY**
That's actually kind of smart.

**MEREMIAH**
Or it's just AI-generated clickbait and we're overthinking it.

**JOYRIDE**
(from the living room)
I'm with Meremiah on this one!

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Of course you are.

They all sit down at the table, plates in front of them. They start eating. The TV stays off. The only sound is the occasional clink of forks against plates and quiet conversation.

**KELLY**
This turned out really good.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Yeah, it did.

**MEREMIAH**
You always make good mac and cheese.

**KELLY**
(smiling)
Thanks. It's all about the cheese-to-pasta ratio.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
What's the ratio?

**KELLY**
More cheese. Always more cheese.

**MEREMIAH**
Words to live by.

They eat in relative silence for a moment.

**KELLY**
Do you guys ever wonder what it would be like if we weren't all living together?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Sometimes. Why?

**KELLY**
I don't know. Just thinking. Like, would we still talk to each other? Would we still care about each other's problems?

**MEREMIAH**
Probably. Family's family, right?

**KELLY**
Yeah, but sometimes I feel like we're only close because we're forced to be. Like, if we all lived in different places, would we actually make the effort?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
That's dark, Kelly.

**KELLY**
I'm just being honest.

**MEREMIAH**
I think we would. At least some of us. Dan would probably still text me about his wall.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(laughing)
"Hey Meremiah, just wanted to let you know my wall is doing great. Thought you should know."

**KELLY**
(laughing)
"Thanks for the update, Dan. Very important information."

They all laugh together, the heaviness of the conversation lifting slightly.

**MEREMIAH**
But seriously, I think we'd stay in touch. We're annoying, but we're not terrible.

**KELLY**
Most of the time.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Most of the time.

They continue eating, the conversation dying down into comfortable silence.

## INT. NEW HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

Jayride walks back upstairs from the kitchen, his plate empty. He's heading toward his room when Not Jeremiah appears from one of the other rooms.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Hey. I need to talk to you about something.

Jayride stops. He looks cautious.

**JAYRIDE**
What's up?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Yesterday. Dan mentioned he saw you doing something near his wall. Near the attic.

Jayride's face goes pale. He knows exactly what Not Jeremiah is talking about.

**JAYRIDE**
I wasn't—

**NOT JEREMIAH**
He said you were playing with yourself. In front of his wall.

Jayride doesn't say anything. He just looks down at his feet.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
Did you touch it? Did you touch the wall?

**JAYRIDE**
No. No, I didn't touch it. I swear. I was just... I was just standing there. I didn't do anything to it.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Standing there doing what, exactly?

**JAYRIDE**
I don't know! I was just... I was curious, okay? Everyone keeps talking about this wall like it's some kind of holy relic, and I wanted to see what the big deal was.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
And?

**JAYRIDE**
And it's just a wall! I don't get it! But Dan saw me there and I guess he thought I was doing something I wasn't.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Were you doing something you weren't supposed to be doing?

**JAYRIDE**
(hesitating)
I mean... not to the wall.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Jesus Christ, Jayride.

**JAYRIDE**
I didn't touch it! I swear on everything, I did not touch that wall!

Not Jeremiah studies him for a moment, trying to figure out if he's lying. Jayride meets his eyes, and something in his expression suggests he's telling the truth.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
You're on restriction for one day. Don't go near the attic. Don't go near that wall. Understand?

**JAYRIDE**
Yeah. Yeah, I understand.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
And for the love of God, find a better place to do... whatever it is you were doing. This house has bathrooms.

**JAYRIDE**
(embarrassed)
I know. I'm sorry.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
One day. Starting now. Get out of my sight.

Jayride nods and quickly heads to his room, closing the door behind him.

Not Jeremiah watches him go, then heads back downstairs.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - JAYRIDE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jayride sits on his bed, staring at nothing. He's clearly bothered by what just happened. His expression shifts from worry to something darker—something more determined.

He stands up and walks to his window, looking out at the neighborhood beyond.

**JAYRIDE**
(to himself)
One day. I can wait one day.

He turns back to face his room. His eyes are harder now. More focused.

**JAYRIDE** (CONT'D)
But after that... I'm going to ruin that wall. Tonight. When everyone's asleep. I'm going to make Dan regret ever accusing me of something I didn't do.

He nods to himself, as if he's made a decision he can't take back. He sits back on his bed and waits.

**JAYRIDE** (CONT'D)
(quietly)
One day. Just one day.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Hours have passed. The house is quieter now. It's evening, and most of the family has retreated to their rooms.

Jayride comes downstairs carefully, moving like he's trying not to make any noise. He checks the security cameras—they're off. He checks the TV—it's off. He checks the fridge—it's closed.

But then he hesitates. He's bored. Anxious. He needs something to do while he waits for midnight.

He opens the fridge.

He stares inside for a moment, then pulls out a whole block of cheese snack. He holds it in his hand, looking at it.

**JAYRIDE**
(to himself)
This will do.

He closes the fridge and sits on the couch, eating the cheese block slowly. But even as he eats, he doesn't feel satisfied. He feels bored. Restless.

He finishes the cheese block and sits back, staring at the wall.

**JAYRIDE** (CONT'D)
(to himself)
Okay. It's almost time. Let's do this.

He stands up, takes a breath, and heads toward the staircase. He moves quietly, deliberately, with purpose.

The camera follows him as he climbs the stairs.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Jayride reaches the top of the stairs and pauses. He listens for any sounds coming from the other rooms. All he hears is silence and the occasional creak of the house settling.

He moves toward the attic stairs.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Jayride climbs the stairs slowly, carefully, making sure each step is silent.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC - NIGHT

Jayride emerges into the attic. It's dark up here. The only light comes from the moon filtering through the glass ceiling above.

He can make out the shape of Dan's favorite wall in the darkness. He stands there for a moment, just looking at it.

Then he hears something.

A sound from behind him. A movement.

He spins around.

MEREMIAH is standing at the top of the attic stairs, eyes barely open, looking half-asleep. One eye is more open than the other, like he's only half-awake.

**MEREMIAH**
What are you doing up here?

**JAYRIDE**
I... I was just...

**MEREMIAH**
You're supposed to be on restriction. You're not supposed to be up here.

**JAYRIDE**
I know, I just—

**MEREMIAH**
Get out. Now. I'm guarding this wall. Dan doesn't trust you near it, and I'm making sure you don't get anywhere close.

Meremiah moves toward Jayride, his movements slow but deliberate. He starts to nudge him toward the stairs.

But then—

JAYSON appears at the top of the attic stairs, having climbed them silently.

**JAYSON**
Hey. I'm coming up too.

Meremiah, already tired, turns to face Jayson.

**MEREMIAH**
No you're not. Go back downstairs.

**JAYSON**
Come on, man. I just want to see the wall. What's the big deal?

**MEREMIAH**
The big deal is that you're not allowed up here. Neither of you are. Dan was very clear about that.

**JAYSON**
Dan's not here right now.

**MEREMIAH**
That doesn't matter. The rule still applies.

**JAYSON**
(stepping closer)
You look tired, Meremiah. Maybe you should go to bed. Let us handle this.

**MEREMIAH**
I'm not going anywhere. You two need to leave. Right now.

Meremiah moves toward Jayson to physically remove him from the attic, but as he does, JAYSON pulls out a small packet from his pocket. It's melatonin powder. He opens it and releases it into the air.

The powder spreads through the attic, floating like dust in the moonlight.

**JAYSON**
This will make everyone have a healthier sleep schedule.

He laughs at his own joke—a harsh, almost maniacal laugh.

**MEREMIAH**
What are you—what did you just—

Meremiah starts to protest, but his eyes are already getting heavy. The melatonin is working faster than it should. He tries to take a step toward Jayson but his legs won't cooperate.

**MEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
You... you can't...

His words trail off. He staggers backward and collapses onto a pile of boxes, his eyes closing. He's asleep almost instantly, his body going completely limp.

Jayson watches him fall with a grin on his face.

**JAYSON**
(to himself)
Perfect.

He pulls out a flashlight and shines it at Jayride, telling him without words to go ahead. This is their moment.

**JAYRIDE**
(whispering)
Are you sure about this?

**JAYSON**
(whispering back)
Too late to turn back now. Come on.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

Jayride wastes no time. He heads straight for the favorite wall. Jayson follows him, shining the flashlight to illuminate the wall in the darkness.

**JAYRIDE**
(looking at the wall)
It really is just a wall. I don't get what Dan sees in it.

**JAYSON**
Who cares? Let's just do what we came here to do.

**JAYRIDE**
You brought everything?

**JAYSON**
(pulling items from his backpack)
Yeah. Got the spray paint, got the markers, got some other stuff too.

**JAYRIDE**
Other stuff?

**JAYSON**
You'll see.

Jayride starts doing things to the wall. Nasty things. Things that Dan would never want anyone to do to his favorite wall.

**JAYRIDE**
(laughing quietly)
This is actually kind of fun.

**JAYSON**
Right? I told you it would be.

**JAYRIDE**
How long do you think we have before someone wakes up?

**JAYSON**
Meremiah's out cold. The melatonin I used is medical-grade. He's not waking up for at least four hours.

**JAYRIDE**
Four hours? That's a lot of time.

**JAYSON**
Exactly. We can take our time. Make it perfect.

The camera doesn't show the details, but it's clear from the sounds and movements that something is happening.

They're lost in what they're doing. They don't notice time passing.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC - TWO HOURS LATER

Jayride and Jayson are still working on the wall. They've been at it for a while now, and their "artwork" has become more elaborate.

**JAYRIDE**
(stepping back to admire their work)
You know what? This is actually pretty good.

**JAYSON**
I know, right? We should do this professionally.

**JAYRIDE**
(laughing)
Professional wall vandals?

**JAYSON**
Why not? There's a market for everything.

**JAYRIDE**
True.

**JAYSON**
(pulling out his phone)
We should document this.

**JAYRIDE**
What?

**JAYSON**
Take pictures. For posterity.

**JAYRIDE**
Are you insane? If anyone finds those pictures—

**JAYSON**
They won't. We'll keep them private. Just for us. Come on, we worked hard on this. We should have proof.

**JAYRIDE**
(hesitating)
I don't know...

**JAYSON**
Fine. I'll take them myself.

Jayson starts taking pictures of the wall, documenting every angle, every detail.

**JAYRIDE**
This feels like a really bad idea.

**JAYSON**
Everything we do is a bad idea. That's what makes it fun.

They continue working, occasionally laughing, completely absorbed in their destruction.

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC - FOUR HOURS LATER

The moon has moved across the sky. The light through the glass ceiling is different now—it's the light of early morning.

Meremiah suddenly stirs. His eyes open. He looks confused, like he's waking from a dream he can't quite remember.

He sits up slowly, looking around.

**MEREMIAH**
(to himself)
What happened? Why am I...

His head is pounding. His mouth is dry. He feels like he's been asleep for days.

He hears noises coming from deeper in the attic. Noises that shouldn't be there at this hour.

**MEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(quietly)
What the hell is that?

He stands up, still groggy, and walks toward the sounds.

He reaches the spot where the favorite wall is and stops cold.

He sees what Jayride and Jayson have done to the wall.

**MEREMIAH**
(in shock)
What the—

His voice is loud. Too loud.

**JAYRIDE**
(spinning around)
Oh shit!

**MEREMIAH**
(looking at the wall in horror)
What did you do? What the fuck did you do to Dan's wall?

**JAYSON**
(stepping forward)
Listen, man, we can explain—

**MEREMIAH**
(voice rising)
Explain? EXPLAIN? You violated his space! You destroyed the one thing he cared about!

**JAYRIDE**
(defensive)
It's just a wall!

**MEREMIAH**
It's not just a wall to him! And you knew that!

Meremiah starts moving toward them, his movements still sluggish from the melatonin but filled with anger.

**MEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
I'm going to wake up Dan. I'm going to wake up everyone. And you two are going to pay for this.

**JAYRIDE**
(panicking)
No, wait—

Jayride looks around frantically and spots a can of ant spray on a nearby shelf. He grabs it.

**JAYSON**
(seeing the spray)
Jayride, don't—

But Jayride is already moving. He runs toward Meremiah and sprays the ant spray directly at Meremiah's face.

The stream hits Meremiah square in the eyes.

**MEREMIAH**
(screaming)
AHHHHH! MY EYES! MY FUCKING EYES!

Meremiah staggers backward, his hands covering his face. He stumbles over a box and falls to the ground, still screaming.

**MEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(screaming)
IT BURNS! OH GOD IT BURNS!

The sound echoes through the house.

It's loud. Loud enough to wake people downstairs.

**JAYRIDE**
(dropping the can, horrified at what he's done)
Shit! Shit, shit, shit!

**JAYSON**
(also panicking)
What did you do!? Why did you spray him!?

**JAYRIDE**
I don't know! I panicked! I didn't want him to tell Dan!

**MEREMIAH**
(on the ground, writhing in pain)
I CAN'T SEE! I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING!

**JAYSON**
(to Jayride)
We need to hide! Now!

**JAYRIDE**
What about him?

**JAYSON**
There's nothing we can do! Come on!

They scramble to find hiding spots in the attic as Meremiah continues to scream, stumbling around blindly, trying to find something to wash his eyes with.

## INT. NEW HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Dan, Not Jeremiah, and Kelly have woken up from the sound of screaming. They're all confused, looking around the living room trying to figure out what's happening.

**DAN**
What was that noise?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Came from upstairs.

**KELLY**
Maybe it was Meremiah?

**DAN**
It sounded like someone was being murdered.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
We should check it out.

**KELLY**
Should we call someone first? Like the police?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
And tell them what? We heard a scream? They'll think we're paranoid.

**DAN**
He's right. Let's just go look.

They all exchange nervous looks. Something doesn't feel right.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Come on. Let's go check it out.

But before they can move, Not Jeremiah stops.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
Actually, let's check down here first. See if anything's wrong.

**KELLY**
Why? The scream came from upstairs.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
I know, but what if someone came in through a window or something? We should make sure the first floor is secure.

**DAN**
That's... actually smart.

Dan nods and they move through the living room, checking things. Dan spots the fridge and opens it.

**DAN**
The cheese snack is gone. Someone ate it.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Who would eat the whole block?

**KELLY**
Was it the good cheese or the cheap cheese?

**DAN**
Does it matter?

**KELLY**
Kind of. If it was the good cheese, we have a real problem. If it was the cheap cheese, then whoever ate it is probably regretting it right now.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Kelly, focus.

**KELLY**
Right. Sorry.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Wait. There's something on the counter.

They walk over to the kitchen counter. There's a block of cheese sitting there, clearly old. The date on it reads 2026.

**KELLY**
This cheese is from 2026. That's... that's really old.

**DAN**
Why would someone leave old cheese out?

**KELLY**
(picking it up)
Maybe they forgot about it?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Kelly, don't—

Without thinking, Kelly picks up the moldy cheese and starts eating it.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
Kelly, stop. That's disgusting.

**KELLY**
(mouth full)
It's fine. It tastes okay.

**DAN**
You're going to get sick.

**KELLY**
Probably, but we need to figure out what happened. This could be a clue.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
A clue to what? Who leaves old cheese as a clue?

**KELLY**
(still chewing)
Someone who wants us to know they were here. Someone who wanted to leave a message.

**DAN**
Or someone who's just really bad at cleaning out the fridge.

Meremiah comes downstairs, looking disheveled and confused. His eyes are red and watery. He looks like he's been crying. He's moving slowly, one hand on the wall to steady himself.

**MEREMIAH**
(voice hoarse)
What's going on? Why is everyone up?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
What happened to you? Your eyes—

**MEREMIAH**
I got sprayed. With something. Ant spray, I think. I was upstairs and—

His voice breaks. He's clearly in pain.

**DAN**
Sprayed? Why would someone spray you?

**MEREMIAH**
Because I caught them doing something. Something bad. Upstairs. In the attic.

Not Jeremiah and Dan look at each other. Their expressions shift to serious.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Who? Who did you catch?

**MEREMIAH**
(wiping his eyes)
Jayride and Jayson. They were doing something to the wall. Dan's wall.

Dan's face goes pale.

**DAN**
(quietly)
No. No, they wouldn't.

**MEREMIAH**
They did. I tried to stop them, but Jayson used melatonin powder on me. Knocked me out. When I woke up, they were still there, and Jayride sprayed me.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
We need to go up there.

**DAN**
(voice shaking)
What did they do to it? What did they do to my wall?

**MEREMIAH**
(looking down)
I don't know exactly. I didn't get a good look before I got sprayed. But it was bad. Really bad.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(to Dan)
Let's go. We need to see this.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
But first, let me check downstairs to make sure nothing else is wrong.

He moves through the house, checking things. Then he stops in the hallway.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
All the drawers are open. Why are all the drawers open?

**KELLY**
(looking around)
Every single one?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(checking)
Yeah. Every drawer in the hallway. Every drawer in the kitchen. What the hell is going on?

**DAN**
(frustrated)
I don't know! But we need to get upstairs!

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Okay, okay. Let's go.

**KELLY**
Should I come?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Yeah. We might need you.

They all head upstairs together, Meremiah leading the way despite his injured eyes.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

They reach the attic and stop in their tracks.

Dan sees his favorite wall.

He doesn't move. He doesn't speak. He just stares at it. At what's been done to it.

The wall is covered in spray paint, marker drawings, and other substances that shouldn't be there. The smell hits them all at once—a sickening, unmistakable smell that makes Kelly gag.

**KELLY**
(covering her mouth)
Oh god. What is that smell?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
I don't want to know.

**DAN**
(quietly)
No. No, no, no.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Oh god.

Dan walks toward the wall slowly, like he's in a trance. He stops in front of it, looking at the damage, at what Jayride and Jayson have done.

**DAN**
(voice breaking)
They... they destroyed it. They destroyed everything.

Dan's face crumples. His eyes fill with tears. He starts crying—not quietly, but openly, his whole body shaking.

**DAN** (CONT'D)
(sobbing)
Why? Why would they do this? I never did anything to them!

**KELLY**
(putting her hand on his shoulder)
Dan, I'm so sorry.

**DAN**
(pulling away)
Don't. Just don't.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(looking around)
Where are they? Where are Jayride and Jayson?

Jayride and Jayson are standing in the shadows of the attic, trying to stay hidden. But Not Jeremiah spots them.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
You two. You did this.

They don't answer. They just stand there, looking at the ground.

## Hours later.

**MEREMIAH**
(from his box)
How long have they been at this?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(checking his watch)
About forty-five minutes.

**MEREMIAH**
How much longer do you think it'll take?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Hours. Maybe all night.

**MEREMIAH**
Good.

**DAN**
(to Jayride and Jayson)
Work faster. The sun's going to be up soon.

**JAYSON**
We're going as fast as we can.

**DAN**
Well, go faster.

Suddenly, a loud CRASH from outside. A window opens—not breaks, but opens forcefully.

MR. HOLT (50s, weathered face, serious expression) climbs through the attic window with a crowbar. He looks shocked, taking in the scene—Jayride and Jayson cleaning, Dan watching, the wall still smelling wrong.

**MR. HOLT**
What in god's name happened here?

Everyone freezes. Nobody was expecting Mr. Holt to show up like this.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Mr. Holt? What are you doing here?

**MR. HOLT**
Your neighbors heard screaming from outside while I was doing my night rounds and I heard someone scream bloody murder. I thought someone was being killed.

**MEREMIAH**
That was me. I got sprayed with ant spray.

**MR. HOLT**
(looking at Meremiah's red eyes)
Jesus Christ. Who did that to you?

**MEREMIAH**
(pointing at Jayride)
He did.

Mr. Holt's expression darkens. He looks at Jayride, then at Jayson, then at the wall.

**MR. HOLT**
(slowly)
Somebody better start explaining what happened here. Right now.

**DAN**
(explaining quickly)
They... they did stuff to my wall. Bad stuff. We made them clean it up.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
They also drugged Meremiah with melatonin powder and then sprayed him with ant spray when he tried to stop them.

Mr. Holt surveys the scene, then looks at Jayride and Jayson with a mixture of disappointment and anger.

**MR. HOLT**
(to Jayride and Jayson)
You two are restricted from the attic. Indefinitely.

He walks over to them, his heavy boots making loud sounds on the attic floor.

**MR. HOLT** (CONT'D)
And I'm taking your phones.

**JAYRIDE**
Not Jeremiah already took them.

**MR. HOLT**
(to Not Jeremiah)
Give them to me.

Not Jeremiah hands over both phones. Mr. Holt takes them and starts scrolling through one of them.

**MR. HOLT** (CONT'D)
Let me see what you've been doing.

He scrolls through it, checking the search history. Nothing comes up.

**MR. HOLT** (CONT'D)
You were in incognito mode.

**JAYRIDE**
(nervously)
Yeah, we were, but we turned it off before—

Mr. Holt opens the browser. His face goes pale as he sees what pops up. There are 83 open tabs—all pornographic sites, all extremely explicit content.

**MR. HOLT**
(quietly)
Eighty-three tabs?

He keeps scrolling. The number keeps going up. 202 inactive tabs. More of the same.

**MR. HOLT** (CONT'D)
(voice rising)
Two hundred and two?

**JAYSON**
(quickly)
Those ad pop-ups kept opening. Every site we went to had the same ad. And when we clicked on one, it just opened more tabs. We couldn't stop them. That's how we lost track of how many we had.

**JAYRIDE**
(nodding frantically)
Yeah, it's like a virus or something. We tried to close them but they just kept opening more.

**MR. HOLT**
(staring at the phone)
Do you have any idea what you're doing to yourselves? Any idea at all?

**JAYSON**
We were just—

**MR. HOLT**
(cutting him off)
Just what? Just destroying your minds? Just corrupting yourselves? Just turning into people who violate other people's property and poison other people and LIE about it?

His hands are shaking. His eyes fill with tears. He sits down slowly on a nearby box, overwhelmed.

**MR. HOLT** (CONT'D)
(quietly)
What are you two doing to yourselves?

Meremiah appears in the attic doorway, looking at the scene unfolding.

**MEREMIAH**
(to Jayride and Jayson)
You two need to leave.

**JAYRIDE**
We're trying to clean—

**MEREMIAH**
I said leave.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Actually, they need to finish cleaning first.

**MEREMIAH**
(voice rising)
They sprayed me! One of them sprayed me in the face with poison!

**JAYRIDE**
(stepping forward)
It was me. I'm the one who did it. I sprayed you. Jayson didn't do that part.

**JAYSON**
(quickly)
But I did the melatonin thing. That was me.

For a moment, Dan looks like he's about to say something harsh. But then his expression softens. He realizes Meremiah is hurt. He starts feeling sorry for him.

**DAN**
(to Not Jeremiah)
He got hurt. Meremiah got hurt.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Yeah. He did.

Dan and Not Jeremiah both start crying—not sobbing, but quiet tears running down their faces. The reality of what happened is finally hitting them.

**KELLY** (O.S.)
(from downstairs)
Hey, can I come in?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(wiping his eyes)
No. The attic is in maintenance right now.

**KELLY** (O.S.)
Okay.

They hear her footsteps heading downstairs.

There's a moment of silence. Everyone is processing what's happened.

Then Meremiah's face changes. His expression shifts from pain to rage.

**MEREMIAH**
(suddenly screaming)
YOU FUCKING WHAT!?

Everyone jumps at the sudden outburst.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Meremiah, calm down—

**MEREMIAH**
(still shouting)
CALM DOWN!? THEY POISONED ME! THEY VIOLATED DAN'S SPACE! AND THEY TOOK PICTURES OF IT LIKE IT WAS SOME KIND OF JOKE!

**DAN**
(putting his hand on Meremiah's shoulder)
I know. I know. But yelling isn't going to fix it.

**MEREMIAH**
(voice breaking)
I tried to protect the wall. I tried to do what you asked. And I failed.

**DAN**
You didn't fail. You got hurt trying to protect it. That means something.

**MEREMIAH**
(sitting back down)
Does it?

**DAN**
Yeah. It does.

Mr. Holt stands up, still holding the phones.

**MR. HOLT**
(to Jayride and Jayson)
You two need to understand something. What you did tonight wasn't just a prank. It wasn't just kids being stupid. You violated someone's trust. You poisoned someone. You documented your crimes like they were entertainment.

**JAYRIDE**
We know. We're sorry.

**MR. HOLT**
Sorry doesn't cut it. You need to feel the weight of what you've done. You need to understand that actions have consequences.

He takes a step toward them, and there's something dangerous in his eyes.

**MR. HOLT** (CONT'D)
And I'm going to make sure you understand.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(cautiously)
Mr. Holt, what are you—

Mr. Holt doesn't answer. He lunges at Jayson, grabbing him by the shirt. He throws him against the attic wall. Jayson hits it hard and staggers forward.

**MR. HOLT**
(shouting)
You didn't mean to? You didn't mean to violate someone's space and then take pictures of it?

**DAN**
(shocked)
Whoa! I've never seen you like this before—

Jayride tries to run, but Mr. Holt catches him by the arm and spins him around. He lands a solid punch directly to Jayride's stomach. Jayride doubles over, gasping for air.

**JAYRIDE**
(struggling to breathe)
Stop! Please—

**MR. HOLT**
(grabbing Jayride's shirt)
You think this is a game? You think this is funny?

He punches Jayride in the face. Blood comes from Jayride's nose. His head snaps back.

**KELLY** (O.S.)
(from downstairs, hearing the commotion)
What's happening up there!?

Jayson tries to crawl away, but Mr. Holt kicks him in the ribs. Jayson cries out, doubling over.

**MR. HOLT**
(breathing heavily)
You two need to understand what you've done. You need to feel it. You need to know the weight of it.

Mr. Holt grabs Jayson and throws him toward the wall. Jayson crashes into it and falls to the ground.

**JAYSON**
(crying)
We're sorry! We're sorry!

**MR. HOLT**
(pointing at both of them)
Sorry doesn't cut it. You violated someone's trust. You violated their space. And then you documented it like it was entertainment.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(stepping forward)
Mr. Holt, I think that's enough—

**MR. HOLT**
(whirling on him)
Enough? ENOUGH? They poisoned someone! They destroyed property! They took pictures like it was a trophy!

He takes a step toward them again, his fists still clenched. He looks at both of them—bloodied, crying, broken on the ground.

**MR. HOLT** (CONT'D)
(quieter, but more intense)
If I ever find out you've done something like this again, I'm going to make sure you regret every second of your pathetic lives. Do you understand me?

**JAYRIDE and JAYSON**
(nodding, crying)
Yes. Yes. We understand.

**MEREMIAH**
(quietly, from his box)
Good.

**DAN**
(to Mr. Holt)
Thank you.

Mr. Holt doesn't respond. He just stands there, breathing heavily, his hands still shaking with anger.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(to Dan and Meremiah)
Come on. Let's go downstairs. Let them finish cleaning.

**DAN**
But I need to make sure—

**NOT JEREMIAH**
They'll finish. And if they don't, Mr. Holt will make sure they do. Right?

**MR. HOLT**
(still staring at Jayride and Jayson)
Right.

Dan, Not Jeremiah, and Meremiah leave the attic slowly, exhausted from the night.
