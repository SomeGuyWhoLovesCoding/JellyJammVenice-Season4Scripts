## INT. NEW HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Kelly comes downstairs quickly, her hand over her mouth. She looks like she's about to be sick.

SUNNY (39) is in the kitchen, having just woken up. She's rubbing her eyes, confused about why everyone is awake.

**SUNNY**
Kelly? What's wrong? Why are you up?

**KELLY**
(holding her mouth)
Something from the attic. I don't know what, but it's making me sick.

Kelly rushes to the sink and vomits. The moldy cheese she ate earlier comes up. It's not pretty.

Sunny winces and turns away, disgusted.

**SUNNY**
Oh my god. What were you eating?

**KELLY**
(wiping her mouth)
Moldy cheese from 2026. Meremiah said I could have a midnight snack.

**SUNNY**
(disappointed)
Kelly. From 2026? That's like—three years old.

**KELLY**
I was really hungry, okay? And I found it in the open drawers in the kitchen. Meremiah let me eat it as long as I didn't disturb anyone.

**SUNNY**
Well, you clearly disturbed someone. What happened in the attic?

**KELLY**
I don't know. But Dan and Not Jeremiah woke up at the same time as me. They went up to check on it.

**SUNNY**
Where are they now?

**KELLY**
They're in the attic. It's in maintenance right now.

Sunny looks concerned. She starts heading toward the stairs.

**SUNNY**
I'm going to go find them.

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

Mr. Holt is still holding Jayride and Jayson's phone. He looks at it, then at them.

**MR. HOLT**
Have you used this phone for anything else? Anything normal?

**JAYSON**
(hesitantly)
We... we took pictures.

**MR. HOLT**
Pictures of what?

**JAYRIDE**
Of the wall. We took pictures of the favorite wall.

Mr. Holt stares at them for a long moment. His face goes red. Every muscle in his body tenses.

**MR. HOLT** (CONT'D)
You took pictures? You documented it? Do you understand how sick that is?

Neither of them answers. They're both in pain.

Dan and Not Jeremiah stand back, watching this unfold. They don't try to stop him.

**MR. HOLT**
(slowly, dangerously)
You documented it.

**JAYSON**
We didn't mean to—

Mr. Holt lunges at Jayson, grabbing him by the shirt. He throws him against the attic wall. Jayson hits it hard and staggers forward.

**MR. HOLT**
(shouting)
You didn't mean to? You didn't mean to violate someone's space and then take pictures of it?

Jayride tries to run, but Mr. Holt catches him by the arm and spins him around. He lands a solid punch directly to Jayride's stomach. Jayride doubles over, gasping for air.

**JAYRIDE**
(struggling to breathe)
Stop! Please—

**MR. HOLT**
(grabbing Jayride's shirt)
You think this is a game? You think this is funny?

He punches Jayride in the face. Blood comes from Jayride's nose. His head snaps back.

Jayson tries to crawl away, but Mr. Holt kicks him in the ribs. Jayson cries out, doubling over.

**MR. HOLT** (CONT'D)
(breathing heavily)
You two need to understand what you've done. You need to feel it. You need to know the weight of it.

Mr. Holt grabs Jayson and throws him toward the wall. Jayson crashes into it and falls to the ground.

**DAN**
Whoa! I've never seen you like this before—

**JAYSON**
(crying)
We're sorry! We're sorry!

**MR. HOLT**
(pointing at both of them)
Sorry doesn't cut it. You violated someone's trust. You violated their space. And then you documented it like it was entertainment.

He takes a step toward them again, but he stops. He's breathing heavily, his fists still clenched. He looks at both of them—bloodied, crying, broken on the ground.

**MR. HOLT** (CONT'D)
(quieter, but more intense)
If I ever find out you've done something like this again, I'm going to make sure you regret every second of your pathetic lives. Do you understand me?

**JAYRIDE and JAYSON**
(nodding, crying)
Yes. Yes. We understand.

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC/STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER

Dan and Not Jeremiah leave the attic and head downstairs. They're exhausted, emotionally drained from the night.

As they reach the bottom of the stairs, they encounter Kelly and Sunny.

Sunny looks relieved to see them.

**SUNNY**
There you are. Are you two okay? What happened up there?

**DAN**
(quietly)
It's complicated.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
We're fine. Everyone's okay.

Sunny studies their faces, then without another word, she pulls both of them into a hug. Kelly joins in as well.

They stand there together, not speaking, just holding each other.

Through the windows behind them, the sun starts to rise. The sky transitions from dark to pink to orange.

The camera pulls back slowly as they hug, showing the moment of quiet comfort after a chaotic night.

A title card appears on the screen: **4:50 AM**

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC - MORNING

Jayride and Jayson stand in the attic, both looking defeated and ashamed. Their faces are bruised from Mr. Holt's punches. They're not cleaning anymore—they're just standing there.

Mr. Holt is packing up. He's putting things into a bag, clearly preparing to leave the house.

**MR. HOLT**
(to Jayride and Jayson)
You two need to think about what you've done. Really think about it. Not just tonight, but everything.

**JAYRIDE**
We're sorry. We really are.

**MR. HOLT**
Being sorry doesn't change anything. You need to understand the consequences of your actions.

He finishes packing and heads downstairs.

## EXT. NEW HOUSE - BACK YARD - EARLY MORNING

Jayride and Jayson walk outside into the early morning light. The sun is just starting to fully rise. The sky is a mix of orange and pink.

They stand together, looking at the ground.

JOEYSON (another character) walks up to them, looking confused about what's happening.

**JOEYSON**
What's going on? Why are you two outside?

**JAYRIDE**
(looking up at the sky)
We did something really bad. And we're trying to figure out how to make it right.

Jayson nods in agreement.

They both kneel down and look up toward the sky.

**JAYRIDE** (CONT'D)
(to god, or the universe, or whoever is listening)
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what we did. I'm sorry for what we became. We weren't thinking. We were just... we were lost.

**JAYSON**
(nodding)
Yeah. We're sorry. We're really sorry.

Calm music begins to play—soft, contemplative, forgiving. Not upbeat, not celebratory, but peaceful.

Joeyson joins them, kneeling down beside them in solidarity.

They stand there together in the early morning light, the music playing softly around them.

## EXT. SPACE - MORNING

The camera pulls back from the house, further and further away, into the sky, past the clouds, past the atmosphere, into space.

The Earth becomes smaller and smaller as we zoom out.

Then the camera cuts to a different location—a solitary confinement cell.

---

## INT. SOLITARY CONFINEMENT CELL - MORNING

NCTEJ=7/ (a pilot character, mysterious and weathered by their crimes) sits on a small bed in a concrete cell. The walls are bare. There's a small window with bars.

She's holding a phone and typing on it, working on a private text file. She's writing an escape plan—detailed, methodical, precise.

Her fingers move quickly across the screen as she types.

The camera shows close-ups of her face—focused, determined, almost serene in her resolve.

She finishes typing something and reads it over to herself, nodding slightly.

**NCTEJ=7/**
(to herself)
Almost ready. Almost time.

She continues typing.

## FADE OUT

## END OF ACT 4 AND EPISODE


Fuck off there's one more act as I've realized the fact that the episode would be around 45-55 mins, as claude.ai had estimated.
