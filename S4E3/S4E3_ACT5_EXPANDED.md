## INT. NEW HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Kelly comes downstairs quickly, practically running, her hand over her mouth. She looks pale, sick. Something from the attic—the smell, the stress, the old cheese—has caught up with her.

SUNNY (39, maternal, concerned) is in the kitchen, having just woken up from all the commotion. She's wearing a bathrobe, her hair slightly messy. She's rubbing her eyes, confused about why everyone is awake at this ungodly hour.

**SUNNY**
(seeing Kelly, concerned)
Kelly? What's wrong? Why are you up? What's happening upstairs?

**KELLY**
(holding her mouth, her voice muffled)
Something from the attic. The smell. And I ate that old cheese. I don't know what, but it's making me sick.

Kelly rushes to the sink and vomits violently. The moldy cheese she ate earlier comes up, along with everything else in her stomach. It's not pretty.

Sunny winces and turns away, disgusted but also concerned. She moves to the sink and puts her hand on Kelly's back supportively.

**SUNNY**
(rubbing Kelly's back)
Oh my god. Just breathe. It's okay. Get it all out.

**KELLY**
(between heaves, gasping)
I'm sorry. I'm sorry about the sink.

**SUNNY**
(kindly)
Don't worry about the sink. Just focus on breathing. What were you eating?

**KELLY**
(wiping her mouth, breathing hard)
Moldy cheese from 2026. Old cheese. Really old cheese.

**SUNNY**
(disappointed, maternal)
Kelly. From 2026? That's three years old. Three years!

**KELLY**
(defensive, rinsing her mouth)
I was really hungry, okay? And I found it on the counter. It was just sitting there. Meremiah said I could have a midnight snack, so I thought...

**SUNNY**
(sighing)
Meremiah told you that you could eat three-year-old cheese?

**KELLY**
(backtracking)
No. He said I could have a midnight snack. I found the cheese myself. This is on me.

**SUNNY**
(concerned, getting her a glass of water)
Here. Drink this. Rinse your mouth out. You need to stay hydrated.

Kelly takes the water gratefully and drinks, then rinses her mouth out in the sink.

**SUNNY** (CONT'D)
(more seriously)
Now tell me what's really happening. What happened in the attic? I heard screaming earlier. Horrible screaming.

**KELLY**
(wiping her face with a towel)
I don't know all the details. But Dan's wall got vandalized. Someone destroyed it. And Meremiah got hurt trying to stop them.

**SUNNY**
(alarmed)
Hurt how? Is he okay?

**KELLY**
(nodding)
He'll be okay. He got sprayed with ant spray in the eyes. It looks really painful, but I think he'll recover.

**SUNNY**
(horrified)
Who would spray someone with ant spray?

**KELLY**
(quietly)
Jayride. And Jayson was involved too. They were vandalizing Dan's wall and Meremiah tried to stop them.

**SUNNY**
(processing this, getting angry)
Those two boys. I've told Charlie about them. They're trouble. Where are they now?

**KELLY**
In the attic. Mr. Holt showed up. He's dealing with it.

**SUNNY**
(concerned)
Mr. Holt is here? How did he—

**KELLY**
He climbed through a window. Someone called him about the screaming.

**SUNNY**
(looking toward the stairs)
I should go up there. Make sure everyone's okay.

**KELLY**
(quickly)
No. Not Jeremiah said the attic is in maintenance. He told me to stay down here.

**SUNNY**
(conflicted)
But if people are hurt—

**KELLY**
They're handling it. I think... I think it's better if we stay down here. Let them deal with it.

Sunny looks uncertain, torn between maternal instinct and trusting the situation is being handled.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

Mr. Holt is still holding Jayride and Jayson's phones. He looks at them again, scrolling through the photos they took, and his face reddens with renewed anger.

**MR. HOLT**
Have you used these phones for anything else? Anything normal? Anything that isn't destructive or corrupting?

**JAYSON**
(hesitantly, scared)
We... we took pictures. Of the wall.

**MR. HOLT**
(his voice dangerously quiet)
Pictures of what, exactly?

**JAYRIDE**
(barely able to speak)
Of the wall. We took pictures of the favorite wall. After we... after we vandalized it.

Mr. Holt stares at them for a long moment. His face goes from pale to red. Every muscle in his body tenses. His breathing gets heavier.

**MR. HOLT**
(his voice shaking with rage)
You took pictures? You documented it? You preserved this moment? Do you understand how sick that is?

Neither of them answers. They're both too scared, too ashamed.

**MR. HOLT** (CONT'D)
(slowly, his voice getting louder)
You didn't just destroy his property. You didn't just hurt someone. You DOCUMENTED it. You saved it. You wanted to remember it. You wanted to look back on this and laugh.

**JAYSON**
(desperately)
We didn't mean to—

Mr. Holt lunges at Jayson without warning, grabbing him by the front of his shirt with both hands. He throws him hard against the attic wall—not Dan's wall, but another wall nearby. Jayson hits it with a sickening thud and staggers forward, gasping, the wind knocked out of him.

**MR. HOLT**
(shouting, his voice raw)
You didn't mean to? You didn't mean to violate someone's space and then take pictures of it like it was some kind of achievement?

**DAN**
(shocked, taking a step back)
Whoa! Mr. Holt, I've never seen you like this before—

Jayride sees his chance and tries to run, his survival instincts kicking in. But Mr. Holt is faster despite his age. He catches Jayride by the arm and spins him around with surprising strength. He lands a solid punch directly to Jayride's stomach. The impact is brutal.

Jayride doubles over immediately, gasping for air, unable to breathe.

**JAYRIDE**
(struggling to breathe, wheezing)
Stop! Please—I can't—

**MR. HOLT**
(grabbing Jayride's shirt, pulling him close)
You think this is a game? You think this is funny? You think you can destroy people's things and hurt people and document it and there won't be consequences?

He punches Jayride in the face. Hard. Blood immediately starts flowing from Jayride's nose, streaming down his face. His head snaps back from the impact.

**KELLY** (O.S.)
(from far downstairs, hearing the commotion, alarmed)
What's happening up there!? That doesn't sound like cleaning!

Nobody answers her. Everyone in the attic is frozen, watching.

Jayson tries to crawl away on his hands and knees, scrambling across the attic floor. But Mr. Holt sees him and moves. He kicks Jayson hard in the ribs. The sound is sickening. Jayson cries out in pain and collapses, clutching his side, gasping.

**MR. HOLT**
(breathing heavily, standing over them)
You two need to understand what you've done. You need to FEEL it. You need to know the weight of it. You need to understand that actions have consequences!

He grabs Jayson by the back of his shirt and physically throws him toward the wall again. Jayson crashes into it and falls to the ground hard, groaning in pain, curling into a fetal position.

**JAYSON**
(crying now, his voice breaking)
We're sorry! We're sorry! Please stop!

**MR. HOLT**
(pointing at both of them, his finger shaking)
Sorry doesn't cut it! Sorry doesn't mean anything! You violated someone's trust! You violated their space! You poisoned someone! And then you documented it all like it was entertainment! Like you were proud!

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(stepping forward carefully)
Mr. Holt, I think that's enough—

**MR. HOLT**
(whirling on him, his eyes wild)
Enough? ENOUGH!? They poisoned someone! They destroyed property! They assaulted someone! They took pictures like it was a trophy! And you think that's ENOUGH punishment?

He takes a step toward them again, his fists still clenched, his breathing heavy. He looks at both of them—bloodied, crying, broken on the ground—and for a moment it seems like he might continue.

Dan watches, his expression complicated—horror at the violence, but also something else. Satisfaction? Vindication?

Mr. Holt grabs Jayride again and hits him one more time, this time in the face. More blood. Jayride's head snaps to the side.

**JAYRIDE**
(crying, bleeding)
Please stop! Please!

**MR. HOLT**
(quieter now, but more intense)
If I ever—and I mean EVER—find out you've done something like this again, I'm going to make sure you regret every second of your pathetic lives. Do you understand me? Do you comprehend what I'm telling you?

**JAYRIDE and JAYSON**
(nodding frantically, crying, bleeding)
Yes! Yes! We understand! We're sorry! We'll never do it again!

**MEREMIAH**
(quietly, from his box, still holding his compress)
Good. They needed that.

**DAN**
(to Mr. Holt, his voice shaking but grateful)
Thank you. Thank you for... for making them understand.

Mr. Holt doesn't respond. He just stands there, breathing heavily, his hands still shaking with anger and adrenaline. He looks at his hands—at the blood on them—and something in his expression shifts.

**MR. HOLT**
(to the boys, calmer now but still hard)
Finish cleaning. And when you're done, you're going to stay up here until morning. You're going to sit here and think about what you did. And tomorrow, we're going to have a long conversation about consequences.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(to Dan and Meremiah, quietly)
Come on. Let's go downstairs. Let them finish. Let Mr. Holt handle this.

**DAN**
(hesitating, looking at the wall)
But I need to make sure they clean it properly—

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(firmly)
They'll clean it. And if they don't, Mr. Holt will make sure they do. Right?

**MR. HOLT**
(still staring at the boys)
Right. I'll make sure.

Dan, Not Jeremiah, and Meremiah leave the attic slowly, exhausted from the night, traumatized by what they've witnessed. Their footsteps on the stairs are heavy, defeated.

Mr. Holt stays behind, watching Jayride and Jayson as they slowly, painfully get back to their feet and return to cleaning the wall, their movements agonized, their faces streaked with blood and tears.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC/STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER

Dan and Not Jeremiah walk down the stairs together, with Meremiah following behind carefully. They're exhausted, emotionally drained from the night, physically exhausted from the stress.

As they reach the bottom of the attic stairs and enter the upstairs hallway, they encounter Kelly and Sunny, who have come up to check on them.

Sunny looks relieved to see them, but also concerned when she sees their faces—Dan's eyes red from crying, Not Jeremiah looking shaken and pale, Meremiah still holding his compress.

**SUNNY**
(rushing toward them)
There you are! Are you two okay? Are all of you okay? What happened up there?

**DAN**
(quietly, his voice hoarse from crying)
It's complicated. It's really complicated.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(shaking his head)
We're fine. Everyone's okay. Physically, at least.

Sunny studies their faces, knowing they're not telling her everything. But she also knows this isn't the time to press for details. She can see they're traumatized, exhausted.

Instead, without another word, she pulls both Dan and Not Jeremiah into a tight hug. A mother's hug. Protective, comforting, safe.

They stand there for a moment, surprised, then both of them hug her back. Dan's shoulders start shaking—he's crying again, quietly this time.

Kelly watches for a moment, then joins in as well, wrapping her arms around all of them, creating a group hug in the hallway.

Meremiah stands nearby, watching. After a moment, Sunny reaches out and pulls him in too, careful of his injured eyes.

They stand there together in the hallway, not speaking, just holding each other in the quiet darkness.

Through the windows behind them, the sun starts to rise. The sky transitions slowly from dark navy to deep blue to purple to pink to orange. Dawn is breaking.

The camera pulls back slowly as they hug, showing the moment of quiet comfort after a chaotic, violent night.

A title card appears on the screen: **4:50 AM**

The embrace continues for another long moment, then they slowly separate.

**SUNNY**
(looking at each of them)
Whatever happened, we'll deal with it tomorrow. Right now, you all need rest.

**DAN**
(nodding weakly)
Yeah. Rest sounds good.

They start heading downstairs together, a united family despite everything.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC - MORNING

Jayride and Jayson stand in the attic, both looking defeated and ashamed and in serious pain. Their faces are bruised from Mr. Holt's punches. Jayride's nose is swollen, still bleeding slightly. Jayson is holding his ribs, wincing with every breath.

They're not cleaning anymore—the wall is as clean as they can make it, though you can still see faint traces of what they did. They're just standing there, exhausted, contemplating what they've done and what was done to them.

Mr. Holt is packing up his things. He's putting tools into a bag, clearly preparing to leave the house.

**MR. HOLT**
(to Jayride and Jayson, his voice calmer now but still stern)
You two need to think about what you've done. Really think about it. Not just tonight, but everything. Every choice that led you here.

**JAYRIDE**
(his voice barely above a whisper, pained)
We're sorry. We really are sorry.

**MR. HOLT**
(stopping his packing, looking at them)
Being sorry doesn't change anything. Being sorry doesn't undo what you did. You need to understand the consequences of your actions. You need to understand that what you do affects other people. Real people with real feelings.

He finishes packing and picks up his bag. He heads toward the window he came through.

**MR. HOLT** (CONT'D)
(pausing at the window, looking back)
I'm going to be watching you two. If I ever hear about you doing something like this again—anything like this—there will be consequences. Worse consequences. Do you understand?

**JAYRIDE and JAYSON**
(nodding, scared)
Yes sir. We understand.

**MR. HOLT**
(climbing through the window)
Good.

He disappears through the window, leaving them alone in the attic with their guilt and their pain.

## EXT. NEW HOUSE - BACK YARD - EARLY MORNING

The sun is fully rising now, painting the sky in brilliant oranges and pinks and golds. It's beautiful—a stark contrast to the darkness of the night.

Jayride and Jayson walk outside into the early morning light, moving slowly, their bodies aching. They stand together in the backyard, looking at the ground, not speaking.

JOEYSON (another character, a friend of theirs, concerned) walks up to them from the side of the house. He sees their faces—the bruises, the blood, the exhaustion—and stops.

**JOEYSON**
(alarmed)
What's going on? Why are you two outside? And what happened to your faces? Did you get in a fight?

**JAYRIDE**
(looking up at the sky, his voice hollow)
We did something really bad. And we're trying to figure out how to make it right.

Jayson nods in agreement, wincing as the movement hurts his ribs.

**JOEYSON**
(concerned)
What did you do?

**JAYRIDE**
(not answering directly)
Something we can't take back.

They both kneel down slowly, painfully, on the grass and look up toward the sky. The morning sun is warm on their faces.

**JAYRIDE** (CONT'D)
(to god, or the universe, or whoever is listening)
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what we did. I'm sorry for what we became tonight. We weren't thinking. We were just... we were lost. We were angry and stupid and we hurt people.

**JAYSON**
(nodding, his voice breaking)
Yeah. We're sorry. We're really sorry. We don't know how to fix this, but we're sorry. We know sorry isn't enough, but it's all we have right now.

Calm music begins to play—soft, contemplative, forgiving. Not upbeat, not celebratory, but peaceful. The kind of music that suggests healing is possible, even if it's far away and difficult.

Joeyson looks at them for a moment, not fully understanding what happened but recognizing genuine remorse when he sees it. He slowly kneels down beside them in solidarity, offering his silent support.

They stay there together in the early morning light, the music playing softly around them, the sun rising behind them, three boys contemplating mistakes and consequences.

---

## EXT. SPACE - MORNING

The camera pulls back from the house, further and further away, rising into the sky like a bird. We see the neighborhood, then the town, then the county.

Higher and higher, past the clouds, past the atmosphere, into space.

The Earth becomes smaller and smaller as we zoom out, showing the vastness of everything, the smallness of this one house, this one night, in the grand scheme of things.

Then the camera cuts sharply to a different location—somewhere far away from the house, somewhere dark and cold and confined.

---

## INT. SOLITARY CONFINEMENT CELL - MORNING

NCTEJ=7/ (mid-30s, hardened by years of incarceration, her face weathered but her eyes sharp and calculating) sits on a small concrete bed in a tiny cell. The walls are bare concrete. There's a small window with bars, letting in a thin shaft of morning light that illuminates dust particles in the air.

She's holding a phone—a contraband phone, somehow smuggled into her cell despite the isolation. She's typing on it, working on a private text file. She's writing an escape plan—detailed, methodical, precise.

Her fingers move quickly across the screen as she types, her expression focused, determined. Years of planning have led to this.

The camera shows close-ups of her face as she works—focused, determined, almost serene in her resolve. This is someone who has spent every moment of the last eighteen months planning this. Every detail considered. Every contingency prepared for.

She finishes typing something and reads it over to herself, her lips moving silently. She nods slightly, satisfied.

**NCTEJ=7/**
(to herself, a slight smile on her lips)
Almost ready. Almost time. Just a few more pieces to move into place.

She continues typing, adding more details, refining the plan. Her eyes flick to the barred window briefly, then back to the phone.

**NCTEJ=7/** (CONT'D)
(to herself)
They think I'm contained. They think these walls can hold me. They're wrong.

The camera slowly pulls back, showing her alone in her cell, the phone glowing in the dim light, the only source of brightness in the oppressive darkness.

## NOTES FOR PRODUCTION:

- Mr. Holt's violence should be shocking but feel consequential
- Kelly's vomiting provides brief dark humor relief amid darkness
- The family hug should feel genuinely warm and healing
- Sunrise should be filmed beautifully—hope after darkness
- Prayer scene should feel genuine, not performative
- NCTEJ introduction should be mysterious and ominous
- Music should shift from violent to peaceful to ominous
- The space pullback should emphasize perspective shift
- End on clear setup for Act 6's revelations
