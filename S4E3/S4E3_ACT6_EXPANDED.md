## INT. NEW HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

The sun is now fully up, streaming through the windows in bright, warm rays. Morning light floods the living room, making everything look clean and new despite the exhaustion hanging in the air.

The living room is quiet except for the soft hum of the TV playing in the background.

Dan is sprawled out on one couch, his head resting against a pillow, finally asleep after the traumatic night. His face is peaceful now, the stress temporarily erased by sleep. Not Jeremiah is on another couch, one arm hanging over the side, also sleeping. Kelly is curled up in an armchair with a blanket pulled up to her chin, her breathing slow and steady. Meremiah is on a third couch, his eyes barely open, the compress still on his face, staring at nothing in particular, unable or unwilling to fully sleep.

The TV plays softly in the background. A morning news program. The cheerful ANCHOR is discussing weather and local events—normal, mundane things. None of them are really paying attention. They're all too exhausted.

Minutes pass slowly. The news continues. Dan's breathing becomes deeper, more regular—he's fully asleep now, probably for the first time in hours. Kelly's head tilts to the side against the armchair. Even Not Jeremiah's eyes are closed completely, his face relaxed.

Meremiah struggles to keep his eyes open, fighting against the exhaustion pulling him down into sleep, but the melatonin from last night is still affecting him.

The news transitions to a new segment. The cheerful music changes to something more serious.

**NEWS ANCHOR** (V.O.)
(on TV, her tone shifting to serious)
We're continuing to follow the developing story about the NCTEJ=7/ escape plan that was leaked to multiple news outlets earlier this week. When we first reported on this story, authorities initially dismissed it as a hoax, likely generated by artificial intelligence. However, new evidence has emerged that suggests otherwise.

Meremiah's eyes flutter. He's barely conscious, fighting to stay awake, but something about the words penetrates the fog.

**NEWS ANCHOR** (V.O.) (CONT'D)
(on TV)
In an exclusive report, we've learned that NCTEJ=7/ has been using her time in solitary confinement to plan what authorities are now calling an "inevitable escape attempt." We'll have more details after this break.

Meremiah tries to focus on the TV, but his eyes won't stay open. The words wash over him.

The TV cuts to a commercial—bright, cheerful, selling car insurance.

The door to the living room opens suddenly, loudly.

MR. HOLT (50s, weathered, serious, looking like he hasn't slept at all) walks in briskly. He's changed clothes since leaving the attic, but he still looks rough. He's holding a newspaper in one hand and a large cup of coffee in the other. He looks like he's been up all night, researching, thinking, planning.

He walks straight to the TV and turns up the volume significantly, making it loud enough to wake the dead.

Everyone jolts awake at once, startled by the sudden noise.

Dan's eyes snap open wide. Not Jeremiah sits up quickly, disoriented, looking around frantically. Kelly gasps and pulls the blanket down, her heart racing. Meremiah, startled, nearly falls off his couch.

**DAN**
(groggy, confused, alarmed)
What—what's happening?

**MR. HOLT**
(cutting him off, his voice firm and commanding)
Don't move. Don't talk. Watch this. All of you need to watch this right now.

He stands in front of the TV, partially blocking their view but not entirely. He's intentionally making sure they pay attention.

The news comes back from commercial break.

**NEWS ANCHOR**
(on TV, serious)
We're back with breaking news regarding NCTEJ=7/. For those just tuning in, authorities have now confirmed that the escape plan leaked earlier this week is absolutely legitimate. This is not, and I repeat, NOT a hoax or AI-generated content. The FBI has verified the authenticity of the documents and is treating this as an active threat.

Mr. Holt turns around to face them, his expression stern and intense.

**MR. HOLT**
(pointing at the TV)
If any of you thought that was AI, you need to stop thinking that right now. You need to stop dismissing things just because they sound unbelievable or convenient to ignore.

Dan and Meremiah exchange looks, their faces pale. They're suddenly very awake, very alert.

**MEREMIAH**
(sitting up fully, wincing from his sore eyes)
How do you know this is real? How do you know it's not just another fake news story?

**MR. HOLT**
(his voice grave, serious)
Because I know the world. I've been doing security work for twenty years. And I know when something is a genuine threat versus noise. This is a threat. A real, credible, active threat.

Dan reaches for his tea cup on the coffee table with a trembling hand. He brings it to his lips and takes a long sip, trying to process what Mr. Holt is saying, trying to wake up fully.

Meremiah does the same, reaching for his own cup and drinking deeply, his other hand still holding the compress to his face.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(fully awake now, focused)
What exactly is happening? What did she do? Why is this so serious?

**MR. HOLT**
(sitting down heavily in a chair)
Just listen. Watch the screen. Pay attention.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The TV continues with the news report. Everyone is paying full attention now, their exhaustion temporarily forgotten.

**NEWS ANCHOR**
(on TV)
According to our sources, NCTEJ=7/ has been in solitary confinement for the past eighteen months. During that time, she has meticulously planned her escape. We've obtained documents—verified by federal authorities—showing her methods, her timeline, and most disturbingly, her network of accomplices on the outside.

An IMAGE appears on the screen—a document with handwriting on it. The camera zooms in enough to show it's detailed, organized, methodical. Lists and diagrams and coded messages. Plans within plans.

**NEWS ANCHOR** (CONT'D)
(on TV)
What makes this case unique and particularly dangerous is her ability to coordinate with people outside the prison walls despite being completely isolated in solitary confinement. Investigators believe she's been using a contraband phone—a phone that somehow made it into her cell. We don't yet know how, but authorities are investigating.

Dan and Meremiah stare at the TV, their mouths slightly open. Kelly leans forward, completely invested now, her earlier sickness forgotten.

**NEWS ANCHOR** (CONT'D)
(on TV)
In a stunning development, we've also learned that NCTEJ=7/ has been documenting her entire escape plan on this phone. Text files, notes, diagrams, coded messages—all of it stored in encrypted files that she's prepared to distribute to her network once she's outside the prison.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(to Mr. Holt, confused)
Why are you showing us this? What does this have to do with us? With what happened tonight?

**MR. HOLT**
(looking at each of them in turn, his voice serious)
Because the world is bigger and more dangerous than you think. And people like Jayride and Jayson—what they did tonight—they're just the surface. There are bigger players doing bigger things. People who cross bigger lines. People who violate trust on a massive scale.

**KELLY**
(quietly, processing)
That's scary. That's really scary.

**MR. HOLT**
(nodding)
It should be. Because it's real. It's happening right now. While you were dealing with your wall situation, this woman was finalizing plans to escape from federal custody.

The TV continues playing. More details emerge about NCTEJ's history, her crimes, her network.

**NEWS ANCHOR**
(on TV)
Authorities are taking the threat very seriously and have increased security measures at the facility where NCTEJ=7/ is being held. However, they refuse to comment on specific details of the escape plan, citing security concerns. The FBI has issued a statement saying they are monitoring the situation closely and have deployed additional resources.

**MR. HOLT**
(standing up)
Do you understand now? Do you see the connection?

**DAN**
(confused)
Connection to what?

**MR. HOLT**
(turning to face them)
Between what happened in your attic and what's happening out there. Between small violations and large ones. Between people who think rules don't apply to them.

**MEREMIAH**
(considering)
You're saying Jayride and Jayson are like her?

**MR. HOLT**
(shaking his head)
No. I'm saying they're on the same path. Different scale, same disease. They violated someone's space. They documented it. They thought they could get away with it. She's doing the same thing on a much larger scale.

The news segment ends and transitions to something else—sports, weather, something mundane. Mr. Holt walks over and turns off the TV.

The sudden silence is jarring.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The news report has concluded. Dan and the others sit in the aftermath, trying to absorb what they've learned, trying to connect it to what happened in the attic.

**DAN**
(to Mr. Holt, his voice quiet, still processing)
So she's really going to escape? This is really happening?

**MR. HOLT**
(nodding gravely)
She's going to try. Whether she succeeds depends on many factors—security, timing, her network, luck. But the fact that she's been planning it for eighteen months with this level of detail... that's dedication. That's dangerous dedication.

**KELLY**
(confused, looking around at everyone)
But why tell us? Why does this matter to us? We're just kids dealing with our own problems. Why does some prisoner's escape plan have anything to do with what happened with Dan's wall?

**MR. HOLT**
(walking toward the window, looking out at the sunrise)
Because everything matters. Every action, every choice, every violation—it all matters. What happened in the attic of this residence last night is small in the grand scheme of things, but it's part of the same disease. It's part of the same problem.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(leaning forward)
What problem?

**MR. HOLT**
(turning to face them)
People crossing lines. People breaking trust. People thinking they can violate others without consequences. People documenting their violations like they're proud of them.

He walks back toward them, his expression intense.

**MR. HOLT** (CONT'D)
Jayride and Jayson violated Dan's space. They violated Meremiah's body. They documented it. They thought it was fun, thought it was justified. NCTEJ is doing the same thing on a massive scale—violating laws, violating trust, planning to violate her confinement, and documenting every step.

**MEREMIAH**
(quietly, understanding)
It's the same mindset. Different scale, same mindset.

**MR. HOLT**
(nodding)
Exactly. The same belief that rules don't apply to them. That they can do whatever they want. That consequences are for other people.

**DAN**
(softly, realizing)
So what we did tonight—making them clean up, drawing the boundary line, taking their phones—that matters?

**MR. HOLT**
(firmly)
It matters more than you know. You drew a line. You enforced consequences. You made it clear that violations have repercussions. That's exactly what the world needs more of.

**KELLY**
(thinking)
But you also... you hurt them. You hit them. You made them bleed.

**MR. HOLT**
(his expression hardening)
Yes. I did. And I'm not going to apologize for it. Sometimes people need to feel consequences physically to understand them emotionally. Sometimes words aren't enough.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(uncomfortable)
That's kind of extreme, isn't it?

**MR. HOLT**
(looking at him directly)
Is it? They poisoned someone. They assaulted someone. They destroyed property and documented it. What consequence would you suggest? A stern talking-to? A timeout? Those boys needed to understand the weight of what they did. And now they do.

There's an uncomfortable silence. Nobody quite knows how to respond to that.

**DAN**
(breaking the silence)
I'm scared.

**MR. HOLT**
(turning to him)
Of what?

**DAN**
(gesturing vaguely)
All of it. What happened to my wall. What you did to them. What that woman is planning. Everything. It all feels too big, too complicated.

**MR. HOLT**
(sitting down next to him)
It is big. It is complicated. But that's life. Life is messy and complicated and sometimes scary. The question is: what do you do about it?

**DAN**
(quietly)
I don't know.

**MR. HOLT**
(putting his hand on Dan's shoulder)
You drew a line around your wall. You made it clear that it matters. That's what you do. You draw lines. You enforce boundaries. You make it clear that violations won't be tolerated. That's all any of us can do.

Dan nods slowly, processing this.

**MEREMIAH**
(changing the subject slightly)
Do you think she'll succeed? The escape?

**MR. HOLT**
(considering)
I don't know. But I know she's going to try. And I know a lot of people are going to try to stop her. We'll see who wins.

He stands up, preparing to leave.

**MR. HOLT** (CONT'D)
I need to go. I have work. But I want you all to remember what happened tonight. Remember the connections. Remember that small actions lead to big consequences. Remember that drawing lines matters.

**DAN**
(standing)
Thank you. For everything. For... for helping.

**MR. HOLT**
(nodding)
You're welcome. Take care of that wall. And take care of each other.

He heads toward the door, then pauses.

**MR. HOLT** (CONT'D)
And if those two boys ever cross that line again, you call me. Understand?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(nodding)
Understood.

Mr. Holt leaves, closing the door quietly behind him.

Dan, Not Jeremiah, Kelly, and Meremiah sit there in the morning light, trying to process everything—the night, the violence, the news, the implications.

**KELLY**
(after a long silence)
I don't think I can sleep now. After all that.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(agreeing)
Me neither.

**DAN**
(looking toward the stairs)
I need to check on my wall. I need to see how clean they got it.

**MEREMIAH**
(stopping him)
Dan. Give it time. Let it breathe. You can check on it later.

**DAN**
(hesitating)
But—

**MEREMIAH**
(firmly)
Just... give it time. Trust the process.

Dan nods reluctantly and settles back into the couch, though his eyes keep drifting toward the stairs.

They sit there together in the morning light, exhausted but unable to sleep, processing the night they've just survived.

## EXT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - DAY

The scene cuts sharply to a completely different place, far from the house. The contrast is stark—from the warm, safe interior of the house to somewhere cold and threatening.

An outdoor area near what appears to be an old industrial building. It's weathered, forgotten, abandoned. The kind of place people avoid. Graffiti covers the walls in layers. Broken windows stare out like empty eyes. The area is littered with debris.

NCTEJ=7/ (mid-30s, hardened by years of incarceration, her face weathered but her eyes sharp and calculating, wearing civilian clothes now—she's clearly not in prison anymore or this is a planning meeting before her incarceration) stands with a group of FORMER PRISONERS. 

They're all dressed casually, trying to blend in, but there's something dangerous about their presence. The way they stand, the way they move, the way they watch their surroundings—these are people who have been hardened by experience, by violence, by time in the system.

They're talking quietly among themselves, occasionally laughing—a dark kind of laughter that comes from people who have nothing left to lose.

**FORMER PRISONER #1**
(a large man with scars on his face)
You really think this is going to work?

**NCTEJ=7/**
(confident)
I know it's going to work. I've planned for everything. Every contingency. Every variable.

**FORMER PRISONER #2**
(a younger woman with tattoos covering her arms)
But the security—

**NCTEJ=7/**
(cutting her off)
The security is predictable. I've been watching patterns for eighteen months. I know when shifts change, who's lazy, who's thorough. I know everything.

NCTEJ=7/ pulls out a phone—old, beaten up, clearly contraband or a burner. She looks at it for a moment, checking the time, then dials a number.

The phone rings.

## INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - FELONIOUS CHARGES' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

FELONIOUS CHARGES (late 30s, a woman with a sharp mind and sharper instincts, dressed professionally, sitting behind a desk in what looks like a makeshift office—maybe a back room of a legitimate business, maybe something else) is working on a laptop when her phone buzzes.

She sees the number on the screen—a number she recognizes—and her expression doesn't change, but her body tenses slightly. She knows who this is. She knows this call is important.

She answers, her voice carefully neutral.

**FELONIOUS CHARGES**
(into phone, carefully)
Hello?

---

## EXT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - CONTINUOUS

NCTEJ=7/ speaks into the phone. Her voice is calm, collected, dangerous—the voice of someone who has planned every word, every inflection.

**NCTEJ=7/**
(into phone)
It's me. I'm using a secure line. We need to talk about the release note and the timeline.

**FELONIOUS CHARGES** (V.O.)
(into phone, worried)
I told you not to call unless it was an emergency. You know these calls are risky.

**NCTEJ=7/**
(into phone, her voice hardening)
This is an emergency. The plan moves faster now. The news coverage accelerated the timeline. I need you to distribute the petition. The back pages. The coded instructions. Tell them it's a signature drive for prisoner rights reform. Nobody looks at those closely. Nobody cares.

**FELONIOUS CHARGES** (V.O.)
(into phone, more worried)
That's too risky. If they trace it back to me—if they connect the dots—

**NCTEJ=7/**
(into phone, cutting her off)
They won't. Trust me. I've been planning this for eighteen months. Every detail. Every contingency. Every possible outcome. This works or I die in that cell. And I have no intention of dying in a cage.

She hangs up abruptly, ending the conversation before Felonious Charges can argue further.

NCTEJ=7/ puts the phone away and turns back to the group of FORMER PRISONERS. She smiles—a cold, calculated smile that doesn't reach her eyes.

**NCTEJ=7/**
(to the group)
We're almost ready. The pieces are moving into place. Everything is happening exactly as planned.

**FORMER PRISONER #1**
(skeptical)
When?

**NCTEJ=7/**
(looking at the sky, calculating)
Soon. Very soon. Days, not weeks. We move when the conditions are right. And I'll know when that is.

**FORMER PRISONER #2**
(concerned)
What if something goes wrong? What if they've planned for this?

**NCTEJ=7/**
(her voice hard)
Nothing will go wrong. And if it does, we adapt. That's what we do. We survive. We adapt. We overcome.

She pauses, looking at each of them.

**NCTEJ=7/** (CONT'D)
(more intensity)
I didn't spend eighteen months in a concrete box planning this just to fail at the last moment. This is happening. We are making this happen.

They all nod, convinced by her confidence, her certainty.

---

## INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - FELONIOUS CHARGES' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Felonious Charges hangs up and sits back in her chair. She's thinking. Planning. Worrying. Her mind is already working through the logistics, calculating risks, considering variables.

She pulls out a folder from a locked drawer in her desk—inside are dozens of petition papers. On the front, they look completely legitimate: "Prisoner Rights Reform Initiative - Sign to Support Humane Treatment." Official-looking logos. Professional formatting.

On the back of each one, hidden in plain sight among the legal fine print, are coded messages and detailed instructions. Pickup locations. Timelines. Signals. Everything someone would need to be part of the escape plan.

She starts making phone calls, her fingers moving quickly across the phone's screen, sending coded text messages to various numbers. Coordinating. Organizing. Putting the plan into motion.

The camera shows close-ups of her face as she works—focused, determined, methodical, but also worried. This is dangerous. This could all go wrong.

---

## EXT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - CONTINUOUS

Back at the industrial location, NCTEJ=7/ watches as the SUN begins to set. The sky turns orange and red and purple, painting the abandoned building in dramatic, almost apocalyptic colors.

She looks at her phone again, checking something—a message, a notification, a detail. Then she looks out at the city skyline in the distance, visible through the industrial decay.

**NCTEJ=7/**
(to herself, quietly but with absolute conviction)
Soon. Very soon. And then everything changes.

**FORMER PRISONER #1**
(approaching her)
Are you sure about this? Are you absolutely sure?

**NCTEJ=7/**
(turning to look at him)
I've never been more sure of anything in my life. I've planned for this. I've sacrificed for this. I've endured eighteen months in a concrete cage for this. It's happening.

**FORMER PRISONER #1**
(nodding)
Then we're with you. Whatever you need.

**NCTEJ=7/**
(satisfied)
Good. That's what I needed to hear.

The camera pulls back slowly, showing NCTEJ=7/ and the group of FORMER PRISONERS standing together as the sun sets behind them. They're silhouettes now, dark shapes against a burning sky. Ominous. Threatening. Inevitable.

The music swells—dark, ominous, relentless. The kind of music that suggests something is coming, something that can't be stopped, something that will change everything.

The camera continues to pull back, rising into the air, showing the industrial building, the city beyond, the world stretching out in all directions. Showing how small this moment is in the grand scheme, but also how significant.

## FADE TO BLACK

## END OF ACT 6 AND EPISODE

**TOTAL EPISODE RUNTIME: Approximately 56-64 minutes**

---

## PRODUCTION NOTES:

- Mr. Holt's speech should feel like a thesis statement for the episode
- The connection between "small" violations (wall) and "large" violations (escape) should be clear but not heavy-handed
- NCTEJ should feel genuinely threatening and capable
- The sunset scene should be filmed beautifully—ominous but gorgeous
- Music should build throughout to create sense of inevitability
- Final pullback should emphasize both scale and connection
- "TO BE CONTINUED" should feel like a promise and a threat
- Episode should end on clear setup for future episodes about NCTEJ

---

## THEMATIC RESOLUTION:

The episode connects personal violations (the wall vandalism) to societal violations (the escape plan) through the common thread of people crossing boundaries and documenting their transgressions. It asks: where do we draw lines? How do we enforce them? What are appropriate consequences? And it suggests that small acts of boundary enforcement matter in a world where people increasingly believe rules don't apply to them.
