## INT. NEW HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

The living room is a blend of chaos and comfort. Boxes are scattered around with labels like "DISHES" and "BOOKS." Family photos sit on a side table, not yet hung on the walls. The furniture is arranged in a somewhat haphazard way—a couch here, a chair there—as if the family is still figuring out how to make the space work.

Morning light pours through the windows, illuminating dust particles floating lazily through the air.

CHARLIE (49, graying hair, wearing a casual sweater) stands near the kitchen entrance. He leans in close to SUNNY (39, holding a newborn baby wrapped in a soft blanket), and whispers something to her—his words are inaudible to us, but his expression is serious.

Sunny listens intently. She nods and heads toward the kitchen without question, bouncing the baby gently as she goes.

Charlie watches her disappear into the other room, then turns back to the living room just as—

DAN (20, perpetually bouncy, always seems to be moving) comes bounding down the hallway. He spots the furniture and immediately becomes fascinated by a drawer beneath an end table. He jumps on it experimentally. The drawer rattles with his weight.

He jumps again. And again. Each time, he grins wider.

NOT JEREMIAH (20, the more measured of the two, wearing a button-up shirt) watches from across the room with visible concern.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Dan. Don't do that.

DAN bounces once more, completely unbothered.

**DAN**
It's fine! These drawers are sturdy!

**NOT JEREMIAH**
They're not, actually. And you're going to break them.

DAN ignores him and spots the staircase. Without any transition, his interest shifts completely. He bounds toward it, his movements exaggerated and full of energy.

NOT JEREMIAH sighs heavily and follows him.

## INT. NEW HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Dan reaches the top of the stairs, breathing a little harder than he was downstairs. He looks down the hallway at several doors, trying to decide which direction to explore.

He walks toward one of the doors and is about to knock when it opens on its own.

MEREMIAH (21, withdrawn, moving slowly like he's underwater) stands in the doorway. One eye is more open than the other, giving him a perpetually tired appearance. He's wearing the same clothes he's probably been wearing all day.

He sees Dan and the light in his eyes doesn't change.

DAN launches immediately into speech, words tumbling over each other.

**DAN**
Meremiah! Have you heard about Fat Caillou? Five hundred and six thousand pounds! Five hundred and six thousand! That's the biggest person ever recorded in history! Can you imagine? I was reading about it and—

MEREMIAH stares at him with the expression of someone listening to a television in another room.

**MEREMIAH**
No.

**DAN**
—and it's just absolutely wild! Like, that's more than a thousand people combined and—

MEREMIAH, without warning, reaches out and gently nudges Dan to the side. He doesn't say anything. He just moves past him and back into his room, closing the door quietly.

Dan stops mid-sentence, his enthusiasm deflating like a balloon.

NOT JEREMIAH appears at the top of the stairs and winces sympathetically.

**DAN**
(to himself)
Nobody cares about Fat Caillou anymore.

He shrugs it off and heads toward the attic stairs.

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS

Dan climbs the narrow stairs. Each step creaks slightly under his weight. The staircase is cramped, with walls pressing in on either side.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

Dan emerges into the attic. It's cluttered—boxes stacked haphazardly, old furniture covered with white sheets, random items from previous owners collecting dust. Light filters through in strips.

He navigates through the mess with surprising purpose, stepping carefully around obstacles until he reaches a specific spot near the far end of the attic. Above this spot is a glass ceiling, letting in natural light.

Dan stops in front of a wall. Just a regular wall. Nothing extraordinary about it. But Dan looks at it like it's the most important thing in the world. He places his hand on it gently.

He runs his hand along the surface, checking. Looking. Making sure nothing is wrong with it.

This is his favorite wall.

**DAN**
(quietly, to himself)
Still good. Still perfect.

Suddenly, loud voices and laughing echo up the staircase.

JAYSON (15, loud, thinks everything is a joke) and JOYRIDE (17, perpetually smirking) emerge into the attic, still laughing about something between them.

They see Dan by his wall and exchange grins.

**JOYRIDE**
Yo, what's up with this wall? Is this like his thing?

**JAYSON**
(laughing)
Does he have a shrine up here or something?

They laugh at their own joke.

Dan's entire body tenses. He turns to face them, and something shifts in his expression. The bouncy, excitable energy is gone. He's serious now.

**DAN**
Get out.

**JAYSON**
What?

**DAN**
Get out. Now.

There's no room for argument in his voice. He moves toward them with actual purpose, and his expression says he means it.

**JAYSON**
Whoa, okay—

Dan firmly but not aggressively guides them both toward the attic stairs.

**JOYRIDE**
What's the big deal, man?

**DAN**
Just go.

They head back down the stairs quickly, confused by the sudden intensity.

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

Dan immediately turns back to his wall. He inspects it methodically, his hand moving across every inch of the surface. He's checking for anything—smudges, handprints, any sign that someone touched it.

The wall looks exactly as it did before.

Dan takes a breath and steps back, still looking at it.

His expression is different now than it was when he was bouncing on drawers downstairs. There's something protective in the way he stands, the way he looks at this wall. Like it matters in a way he can't quite explain to anyone else.

He reaches out and touches the wall one more time, almost like a goodbye, then turns and heads back toward the staircase.
