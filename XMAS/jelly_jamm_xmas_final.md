## Complete Screenplay - Final Draft

### ACT ONE: THE GREAT PREPARATION

**FADE IN:**

## **INT. THE JAMMBONIANS' HOUSE - DECEMBER 1ST - MORNING**

*Rapid flashbacks begin with quick cuts between different rooms. The walls are red, rooms simplified with manually modeled furniture and heating machines.*

**BELLO** *(adjusting a thermostat)*  
Alright everyone, heaters are going online! Let's get this place toasty!

**GOOMO** *(cranking a large valve wheel)*  
Furnace engine number one... ACTIVATED!

**RITA** *(checking a temperature gauge)*  
We need the hot air circulating to every room before the big freeze hits!

**MINA** *(wrapping herself in a scarf while working)*  
I still can't believe how cold it gets here in December!

---

## **INT. FRONT ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS**

*The door swings open. MR. HOLT, MR. PRESTON, and MR. BRAD enter with armfuls of supplies.*

**MR. HOLT**  
We brought extra insulation foam and emergency heating coils!

**MR. PRESTON** *(struggling with a massive toolbox)*  
And every wrench known to mankind!

**MR. BRAD**  
Let's get these systems running before we all turn into popsicles!

**NATALIE** *(appearing from the hallway)*  
Perfect timing! The west wing is already dropping to freezing!

**MAY**  
We've got the central furnace running, but we need those backup coils stat!

**MR. HOLT**  
On it! Preston, Brad, follow me!

---

**MONTAGE SEQUENCE - "PREPARATION PROTOCOL"**

*Upbeat orchestral music plays*

- NATALIE and MAY connect pipes while sparks fly
- MARIA programs the heating control panel with rapid button presses
- The walls glow red as heating systems activate throughout the house
- Steam pours from vents as the furnace roars to life
- Everyone high-fives in front of the simplified furniture
- The crew drags themselves to their bedrooms, exhausted
- Lights flick off one by one
- The house hums with warmth as snow begins to fall outside

**FADE TO BLACK**

---

### ACT TWO: THE SNOW DAY

**FADE IN:**

## **INT. BELLO'S BEDROOM - MORNING - PRESENT DAY**

*Morning light streams through the window. BELLO's eyes flutter open. He yawns and stretches, then freezes. Everything is unusually quiet.*

**BELLO**  
Wait... why is everything so... quiet?

*He stumbles to the window and gasps.*

**BELLO** *(shouting)*  
EVERYONE! GET UP! YOU GOTTA SEE THIS!

---

## **INT. VARIOUS BEDROOMS - CONTINUOUS**

*The entire crew rushes to their windows.*

**GOOMO**  
WHOA!

**RITA**  
It's everywhere!

**MINA**  
Snow! Actual SNOW!

*Every corner of the continent is blanketed in pristine white snow, sparkling in the morning sun. Trees are frosted, rooftops covered, the entire landscape transformed.*

---

## **INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**

*Everyone frantically gets ready in a chaotic rush.*

**NATALIE** *(hopping on one foot while putting on a boot)*  
Where's my other glove?!

**GOOMO**  
I think I saw it in the furnace room!

**NATALIE**  
Why would it be in the— you know what, never mind!

**MAY** *(wrapped in six scarves)*  
Is this too many scarves?

**MARIA**  
There's no such thing as too many scarves in a winter wonderland!

**RITA** *(tossing MAY another scarf)*  
Here, take one more just to be safe!

**MR. HOLT** *(trying to squeeze through the door with an enormous coat)*  
This coat was labeled "one size fits all"... I think they lied!

**BELLO**  
Maybe try going through sideways?

**MR. HOLT** *(attempting it)*  
Still stuck!

**MR. PRESTON** *(slipping on the icy doorstep)*  
WHOAAA— *(catches himself on the door frame)* —I'm good! I'm good!

**MINA**  
We really need to put salt down on that step.

**MR. PRESTON**  
Or maybe I just need better boots!

**MR. BRAD** *(already outside, rolling a snowball)*  
Less talking, more snowman building! This snow isn't going to sculpt itself!

---

## **EXT. SNOWY YARD - DAY**

**COMEDY MONTAGE - "SNOWMAN CHAOS"**

*Playful winter music*

- GOOMO rolls a snowball that grows massive and chases him down a hill
- RITA builds a perfectly proportioned snowman, only for it to topple when she adds the head
- BELLO and MINA have a snowball fight that accidentally hits MR. PRESTON square in the face
- MAY creates an abstract art snow sculpture that nobody understands (it's just random shapes)
- MR. HOLT's snowman is three increasingly smaller cubes stacked perfectly
- NATALIE builds an army of tiny snowmen
- GOOMO finally stops his giant snowball by crashing into a snow drift

---

## **EXT. SNOWY HILL - SUNSET**

*Everyone sits together on a hill, exhausted but happy, watching the sunset paint the sky orange and pink.*

**BELLO** *(contently)*  
You know... days like this make all the hard work worth it.

**EVERYONE** *(in agreement)*  
Mmhmm.

*A peaceful moment of silence. Snow gently falls.*

**GOOMO**  
My fingers are numb but my heart is warm.

**RITA**  
That's beautiful, Goomo.

**GOOMO**  
Thanks! I made it up just now.

**MINA**  
I haven't had this much fun in the snow since I was a kid!

**MARIA**  
Same! We should do this every year!

**NATALIE**  
Motion approved!

**MAY**  
All in favor say "aye!"

**EVERYONE**  
AYE!

**RITA**  
So... who's hungry?

**EVERYONE**  
ME!

---

### ACT THREE: PIZZA PALOOZA

## **INT. KITCHEN - EVENING**

*The kitchen is now decorated with festive lights, garland draped across doorways, and a small Christmas tree twinkling in the corner.*

*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK*

**RITA**  
They're here!

*The door bursts open revealing THE KOOPLER CREW: DAN, NOT JEREMIAH, MEREMIAH, and JOEYSON.*

**DAN**  
PIZZA PALOOZA TIME!

**NOT JEREMIAH** *(holds up pizza boxes)*  
We brought reinforcements!

**MEREMIAH**  
And by reinforcements, he means six extra-large pizzas!

**JOEYSON** *(sniffing the air)*  
Is that... pepperoni and triple cheese?

---

## **INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS**

*The festive kitchen comes alive with activity.*

**MONTAGE - "PIZZA PARTY"**

*Cheerful holiday music plays*

- Pizza boxes stacked high on the counter
- Everyone grabbing slices and laughing
- MR. BRAD attempts to flip pizza dough (it sticks to the ceiling)

**MR. BRAD**  
I meant to do that! It's... uh... decorative!

- DAN and BELLO arguing playfully over the last slice of supreme

**DAN**  
I called it first!

**BELLO**  
But I touched the box first!

**GOOMO**  
Just split it, you two!

**DAN & BELLO** *(simultaneously)*  
FINE!

- MARIA starts a conga line around the kitchen island

**MARIA**  
Come on everyone! Pizza conga!

- NOT JEREMIAH and MEREMIAH harmonize to a made-up pizza song

**NOT JEREMIAH**  
♪ Pizza, pizza, cheesy and divine! ♪

**MEREMIAH**  
♪ Every single slice is truly fine! ♪

- GOOMO tries to eat a slice that's way too hot

**GOOMO**  
HOT HOT HOT HOT!

**RITA**  
I told you to wait!

- MINA catches the falling ceiling pizza dough on a plate

**MINA**  
Got it! Who wants ceiling pizza?

**EVERYONE**  
NO THANKS!

---

## **INT. KITCHEN - MIDDLE OF PARTY**

*Everyone is still eating and laughing. MEREMIAH stands up and clears his throat.*

**MEREMIAH**  
Attention everyone! Important announcement!

*The room quiets down slightly.*

**MEREMIAH**  
Since we have SO much pizza here, I think we should all agree to save one or two pieces for tomorrow. You know, for breakfast pizza!

**NOT JEREMIAH**  
Breakfast pizza is the best pizza!

**DAN**  
That's actually a really smart idea.

**RITA**  
Agreed! I'm already getting full anyway.

**MARIA**  
Ooh, cold pizza in the morning? Count me in!

**MINA**  
I'll put them in the fridge later so they stay fresh.

**JOEYSON** *(quietly, to himself)*  
Yeah... save them... sure...

*He exchanges a suspicious glance with the pizza boxes.*

**BELLO**  
Great plan, Meremiah! More pizza tomorrow means today keeps giving!

**GOOMO**  
That's some solid pizza philosophy right there.

---

## **INT. KITCHEN - LATER**

*The party winds down. Everyone is full and happy, sprawled across chairs and leaning against counters.*

**GOOMO** *(yawning)*  
I don't think I can eat another bite...

**MINA**  
Best. Pizza. Palooza. Ever.

**NATALIE**  
Same time next year?

**DAN**  
Absolutely!

**MAY**  
I can't believe we actually saved some for tomorrow. That never happens!

**MR. HOLT**  
Shows we're all maturing as pizza enthusiasts.

**RITA**  
Or we just ordered way too much pizza.

**MR. PRESTON** *(laughing)*  
Can there ever be too much pizza?

**MR. BRAD**  
Philosophical question for the ages!

*Camera slowly pans to JOEYSON, who glances left, then right. Everyone else is distracted or closing their eyes.*

**NOT JEREMIAH** *(yawning, not noticing JOEYSON)*  
Man, I'm exhausted...

**MEREMIAH** *(stretching)*  
That snow day really took it out of us.

*JOEYSON's hand creeps toward the pizza box with the saved slices.*

*SLOW MOTION: He grabs one remaining slice.*

**JOEYSON** *(whispering to himself)*  
Don't mind if I do... Nobody will notice just one more...

*He takes a huge bite, then another, finishing the slice in seconds.*

*He smiles contentedly and lays his head down on the table.*

**JOEYSON** *(sleepily, barely audible)*  
Best... Christmas... ever...

*His eyes close as he falls asleep right there on the table, a tiny bit of cheese still stuck to his cheek.*

*Camera slowly zooms out to show the peaceful festive kitchen scene. The Christmas tree lights twinkle softly.*

---

**FADE TO BLACK**

---

### ACT FOUR: THE MORNING AFTER

**FADE IN:**

## **INT. KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING**

*Sunlight streams through the windows. JOEYSON is still asleep at the table, head down, a small bit of dried cheese still on his cheek. The empty pizza box sits nearby.*

*One by one, The Jammbonians and the remaining Koopler Crew members begin to stir and wake up in various spots around the kitchen and living room.*

**BELLO** *(stretching and yawning)*  
Morning already?

**RITA** *(rubbing her eyes)*  
Did we all just sleep here?

**GOOMO**  
I think so... My neck is killing me.

**MINA** *(standing up from a chair)*  
Worth it though. That was an amazing night.

**MEREMIAH** *(suddenly sitting up with excitement)*  
Oh! The pizza! We saved pizza for breakfast!

**NOT JEREMIAH**  
Dude, yes! I've been thinking about breakfast pizza since I woke up!

**DAN**  
Same here! Cold pizza hits different in the morning.

*MEREMIAH walks toward the counter where the pizza boxes are stacked.*

**MEREMIAH**  
Alright everyone, let's see what we've got left—

*Suddenly, from outside, a distant but clear voice SCREAMS:*

**YANNARIS** *(O.S., distant)*  
SURPRISE, MOTHERFUCKERS!

*Everyone freezes.*

**NATALIE**  
What was that?

**MAY**  
Did someone just yell outside?

**MARIA**  
That sounded like—

**MR. HOLT**  
We should probably check that out.

**BELLO**  
Yeah, that didn't sound good.

*MEREMIAH looks torn between checking the pizza and investigating outside.*

**MEREMIAH**  
But the pizza—

**RITA**  
Pizza can wait! Someone's out there!

*Everyone rushes toward the door, leaving JOEYSON still asleep at the table.*

---

## **EXT. FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS**

*The group bursts outside into the bright snowy morning. They stop dead in their tracks, mouths dropping open.*

**YANNARIS** *(standing proudly in front of the vandalized snowmen)*  
SURPRISE, MOTHERFUCKERS!

*The camera pans across the yard revealing the aftermath: All their carefully built snowmen from yesterday have been completely vandalized with crude anatomical additions.*

**YANNARIS**  
I BUILT YOU A NEW AND IMPROVED 3D MODELED COCK, WITH A DICK HOLE ON IT-

*Yannaris pulls out an arm of the snowman.*

**YANNARIS**  
MADE BY JUST DIGGING IN THERE WITH YOUR SNOWMAN'S ARM!

*Yannaris immediately dashes over to Rita's statue, which he modified with an 8-inch snow appendage.*

**YANNARIS**  
And then, Rita, I built you a statue that includes the new and improved 8 incher cock like you wanted!

**RITA**  
Gross... I don't wanna touch that...

**YANNARIS**  
And last but not least...

*Yannaris demonstrates the "snow cock ejaculation test".*

*This grosses everyone out. They suddenly notice a camera set up on a tripod nearby.*

**BELLO**  
WE'RE BEING...FILMED...!

**GOOMO**  
Jesus Christmas, I wonder how that happened!

**MINA**  
Stupid Yannaris at his tactics again!

**MAY & MARIA** *(in unison)*  
EW!

**NATALIE**  
You better drop that act or else you won't be invited to our pizza palooza!

**YANNARIS**  
I just can't...with all those snowmen in the way that look beautiful-

**NATALIE**  
Yeah, because those people just wanna fuck around and do ANYTHING to pull our attention! This is why we left you!

**BELLO**  
Yeah, I thought you changed!

**YANNARIS**  
Look, I'm sorry... I didn't know...

**BELLO**  
It's so cold that you decided to sneak into our backyard at 1 in the morning, which I can CLEARLY see here, and absolutely vandalize everything!

**BELLO** *(CONT.)*  
You know what, just erase all this, and we'll let you into our continued pizza palooza.

**YANNARIS**  
Why would I do that? Aren't you supposed to include me anyway!?

**BELLO**  
N-N-N-NO! YOU DO REALIZE WE CAN'T DELETE THAT SECURITY FOOTAGE RIGHT!? WE DIDN'T INTEND TO FILM ALL OF THIS-

**GOOMO**  
Great, now we have undeletable footage...

**RITA**  
This is DESPICABLE behavior, Yannaris!

**NATALIE**  
That's Nasty! Did you know May and Maria are still children by the end of the day!?

**YANNARIS** *(mumbling)*  
Fuck... I didn't know that...

**BELLO**  
Yeah! At least you didn't gain any more pleasure from that!

**BELLO** *(CONT., sighing)*  
Anyway, let's get to work. We didn't have to today originally, but Yannaris STILL had the audacity to vandalize everything in our backyard to represent t1tties and penis... If it weren't for the security footage being ENCRYPTED in the first place, we'd have the ability to delete it, in essence, since we don't have to have it on our face anymore, but we're still cleaning this up regardless, you know...

*The scene begins to transition while BELLO is still talking, slowly fading to black.*

**FADE TO BLACK**

*(After he finishes talking, the screen is completely black.)*

---

## **INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER**

*The group files back in, still grumbling. MEREMIAH immediately goes back to the pizza boxes.*

**MEREMIAH**  
Okay, NOW let's see about that breakfast pizza! We intentionally saved a slice for everyone!

*He opens the first box. Empty. Opens the second. Empty. Opens the third—*

**MEREMIAH** *(suspicious)*  
Wait a minute... These were supposed to have our saved slices!

*He looks around the kitchen. His eyes land on JOEYSON, still asleep, and the EMPTY BOX right next to him.*

**MEREMIAH**  
JOEYSON!

*JOEYSON jolts awake with a snort.*

**JOEYSON** *(groggy)*  
Huh?! What?! I didn't do it!

**NOT JEREMIAH**  
Dude, did you eat the breakfast pizza?!

**JOEYSON** *(looking at the empty box, then back at everyone)*  
I... uh... I can explain?

**DAN**  
The empty box right next to you is pretty self-explanatory.

**JOEYSON**  
Okay, look, in my defense... it was RIGHT there, and it was calling to me!

**MEREMIAH**  
We ALL agreed to save it for this morning!

**JOEYSON**  
I know, I know! I'm sorry! I have no self-control when it comes to pizza!

**RITA** *(trying not to laugh)*  
At least he's honest about it.

**GOOMO**  
And after everything with Yannaris, I'm too exhausted to be mad.

**BELLO**  
Wait, Joeyson slept through the whole Yannaris thing?

**JOEYSON** *(confused)*  
The what now?

**EVERYONE**  
Never mind.

**MAY**  
So... what are we gonna do for breakfast now?

**MARIA**  
I guess we could make pancakes?

**MR. HOLT**  
I'm down for pancakes.

**JOEYSON** *(sheepishly)*  
I'll help cook to make up for the pizza situation?

**MEREMIAH** *(sighs)*  
Fine. But you're on dish duty too.

**JOEYSON**  
Deal!

*The group starts moving toward the kitchen supplies, the chaos of the morning slowly settling into a new routine.*

*Suddenly, there's a KNOCK at the door.*

**BELLO**  
Uhh, I don't think we should open it.

**DAN**  
Oh! I did that!

**BELLO**  
Who'd you call? Ms Random?

**DAN**  
Yup. I talked about the photo I secretly took in my old iPhone 4 I actually managed to unlock, just by manually brute-forcing it.

**BELLO**  
You WHAT!?

**DAN**  
Ms Random was a teenager at the time she was in the crowd, and I thought her officer uniform looked cool, so I took a picture of it.

**DAN** *(CONT.)*  
But, my parents didn't like it and wanted me to delete it as they thought I took a picture of someone without their consent, so yeah. She's at the door.

*More knocking.*

**BELLO**  
I'M COMING...!

*BELLO opens the door and immediately recoils, grossed out by what MS RANDOM is holding.*

**BELLO**  
Ew, put that away—what is that!?

**MS RANDOM**  
I'll tell you—

**BELLO**  
No! Put that away! I don't wanna smell it and potentially barf!

**MS RANDOM**  
You won't find out what it is, I'll tell you.

*BELLO and each one of his friends start coughing out loud.*

**MR. HOLT** *(from inside)*  
Thankfully I didn't come out. I was too cold to do it anyway.

**MS RANDOM**  
Mr Holt, give Bello some medicine, because-

**MR. HOLT** *(appearing at the door)*  
UUUUGGGHH! What's that!?

**MS RANDOM**  
Chocolate Christmas Edition.

**BELLO**  
A chocolate christmas edition, huh? Can you tell me why it smells like SHIT!?

**MS RANDOM**  
That's exactly what it is. Shit coated with sugar.

**BELLO**  
YOU ASSHOLE! YOU WENT TO THE WRONG HOUSE, FOOL!

**MS RANDOM**  
Now, don't get mad, cuz I did get rid of the smell

**BELLO**  
NO—THAT STILL SMELLS LIKE IT'S MAKING ME BARF!

**MS RANDOM**  
NO THE HELL IT DOESN'T—

**BELLO**  
You tell me that's a fucking chocolate christmas edition, but it's just a piece of YOUR SHIT coated with sugar!

**MS RANDOM**  
So what should I do about it?

**BELLO**  
THROW IT ANYWHERE—DO NOT SHOW THAT AT US AGAIN! JUST THROW IT OUT BY THAT ROAD OVER THERE OR IN THE TRASH!

**MS RANDOM**  
Okay—

*MS RANDOM immediately throws the sugar-coated poop into the road.*

**BELLO**  
I...I didn't mean that, but...okay...

**MINA**  
I'm about to say that "you're not invited to our pizza palooza"!

**GOOMO**  
Pancake palooza.

**MINA** *(to GOOMO)*  
Yeah, I don't care. I just can't believe Ms Random decides to come around us at this time at all...!

**MR. HOLT**  
We thought you changed!

**MS RANDOM**  
Look, sorry, I thought coating poop with sugar would make it sugary and delicious...

**BELLO**  
You are SICK—IN THE FUCKING HEAD! How did your mind even process that!?

**MS RANDOM**  
I don't know.

**BELLO**  
Look, don't do that again, or I won't let you in next year, okay?

**MS RANDOM**  
Okay. I guess I won't.

*YANNARIS suddenly appears from around the corner.*

**YANNARIS**  
Yo, is that my waifu, bro!?

**BELLO** *(laughing)*  
Yes... It is your "waifu".

**MS RANDOM**  
I want food—

**BELLO**  
No—

*BELLO fails to process what MS RANDOM's about to do next.*

**BELLO**  
You should at least...ask...

**GOOMO**  
Alright, we're going back in.

*MARIA suddenly barfs.*

**BELLO**  
Oh Great! You just made Maria barf! Thanks a lot, Ms Random!

*Everyone rushes back inside and shuts the door, leaving YANNARIS and MS RANDOM outside.*

---

## **EXT. FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS**

*YANNARIS and MS RANDOM stand awkwardly outside in the cold.*

**YANNARIS**  
So... you really brought sugar-coated shit to their house?

**MS RANDOM**  
I thought it would be a good gift!

**YANNARIS**  
That's disgusting even by MY standards, and I vandalized their snowmen last night.

**MS RANDOM**  
At least I didn't make them into futanari.

**YANNARIS**  
...Fair point.

*They both stand in silence for a moment.*

**YANNARIS**  
You wanna grab coffee or something?

**MS RANDOM**  
Sure. I need to wash my hands anyway.

*They walk off together through the snow.*

---

## **INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS**

*Everyone is gathered around MARIA, who's still recovering from barfing.*

**RITA** *(handing MARIA water)*  
You okay?

**MARIA** *(weakly)*  
That was... so gross...

**NATALIE**  
I can't believe Dan invited her!

**DAN** *(defensive)*  
I didn't know she was going to bring... THAT!

**NOT JEREMIAH**  
Dude, what made you think inviting Ms Random was a good idea?

**DAN**  
She seemed normal in the picture!

**MEREMIAH**  
A picture from when she was a teenager! People change!

**JOEYSON**  
Yeah, and apparently not for the better!

**BELLO** *(sighing)*  
Okay, everyone calm down. Let's just... forget that happened and focus on making pancakes.

**MAY**  
Can we even eat after that?

**MR. PRESTON**  
I've lost my appetite completely.

**MR. BRAD**  
Same here.

**MINA**  
Maybe we should just take a break and open some windows. Air this place out.

**GOOMO**  
Good idea. That smell is still lingering.

*Everyone starts opening windows despite the cold outside.*

**BELLO**  
You know what? This December has been absolutely insane.

**RITA**  
First the snow, then Yannaris, then Joeyson eating all the pizza, and now... whatever that was.

**NATALIE**  
At this rate, what else could possibly happen?

*Everyone freezes and looks at NATALIE.*

**EVERYONE**  
DON'T JINX IT!

**NATALIE**  
Sorry! Sorry!

*Beat.*

**BELLO**  
Alright, once we air this place out, we're making those pancakes. And NO ONE is inviting anyone else over without checking with the group first.

**DAN** *(sheepishly)*  
Agreed.

**GOOMO**  
Can we add that as an official house rule?

**MARIA** *(still weak)*  
Seconded.

**BELLO**  
Motion passed. Now let's get to work.

*Everyone starts gathering pancake ingredients. Suddenly, MR. PRESTON points accusingly at MR. BRAD.*

**MR. PRESTON**  
You know what? This is all YOUR fault, Brad!

**MR. BRAD** *(confused)*  
Excuse me? How is Ms. Random bringing literal shit to the door MY fault?

**MR. PRESTON**  
Not just that! You jinxed us! Yesterday morning, you said "This is going to be the perfect December!" Remember?

**MR. BRAD**  
So what? That's called being optimistic!

**MR. PRESTON**  
Optimistic? We've had NOTHING but disasters since you said that! The snowmen got vandalized, Joeyson ate all the pizza, and now the sugar-coated poop incident!

**MR. HOLT** *(trying to stay out of it)*  
Guys, I don't think that's how jinxes work...

**MR. BRAD**  
Oh, you want to talk about jinxes? What about when YOU said "At least nothing else can go wrong" right before Yannaris showed up?

**MR. PRESTON**  
That was AFTER you jinxed us! I was already operating under your curse!

**NATALIE**  
Uh, I'm the one who just jinxed us a minute ago...

**MR. PRESTON** *(ignoring her)*  
And another thing! Who suggested we build the snowmen in the FRONT yard where anyone could vandalize them?

**MR. BRAD**  
That was a GROUP decision!

**MR. PRESTON**  
You said, and I quote, "The front yard has better snow!" Well look how that turned out!

**BELLO**  
Okay, this is getting ridiculous—

**MR. BRAD**  
Oh yeah? Well who left the pizza boxes on the counter instead of putting them in the fridge like Mina suggested?

**MR. PRESTON**  
Don't you DARE pin Joeyson's lack of self-control on me!

**RITA**  
They're really going at it...

**MR. BRAD**  
And WHO answered the door for Ms. Random? Oh wait, that was Bello, but you were STANDING RIGHT THERE and didn't stop him!

**MR. PRESTON**  
I was in the back! I specifically said I was too cold to come out!

**MR. BRAD**  
Convenient excuse!

*MR. PRESTON suddenly gets up and starts gathering papers and string.*

**GOOMO**  
What are you doing?

**MR. PRESTON**  
I'm going to PROVE that Brad jinxed us!

*He starts creating a conspiracy board on the wall, connecting events with string.*

**MR. PRESTON** *(pointing at his makeshift board)*  
Look! December 1st - Brad says "perfect December." December 2nd - SNOW happens, which leads to snowmen, which leads to Yannaris!

**MR. BRAD**  
Snow is a GOOD thing!

**MR. PRESTON**  
Not when it enables VANDALISM! Then, Brad suggests we have a pizza party—

**MR. BRAD**  
The Koopler Crew suggested that!

**MR. PRESTON**  
—which YOU encouraged! And that led to Joeyson's betrayal!

**NOT JEREMIAH**  
Hey, don't drag us into this!

**MR. PRESTON** *(adding more string)*  
And THEN, Brad was the one who said "I wonder who's at the door" which made Bello WANT to open it!

**BELLO**  
I don't think I needed encouragement...

**MR. BRAD** *(standing up)*  
You want to play the blame game? Fine!

*MR. BRAD grabs different colored string and starts making his own connections on the board.*

**MR. BRAD**  
Preston, December 1st, 9 AM - YOU said "What could possibly go wrong with the heating system?" BOOM! West wing drops to freezing!

**MR. PRESTON**  
That's not even the same day as my comment!

**MR. BRAD**  
It's the SPIRIT of the jinx! Then YOU were the one who said "I hope Yannaris doesn't find out about the pizza party"—you SPOKE IT INTO EXISTENCE!

**MR. PRESTON**  
I never said that!

**MR. BRAD**  
You were THINKING it! I could see it on your face!

**MINA** *(watching the board)*  
This is... actually kind of impressive?

**MAY**  
They've connected everything to everything.

*The board is now a chaotic web of string, notes, and accusations.*

**MR. PRESTON**  
And let's not forget who ate THREE slices of pizza, reducing our backup breakfast supply!

**MR. BRAD**  
That's grasping at straws and you know it!

**MR. PRESTON**  
The math PROVES you contributed to the shortage!

**JOEYSON** *(quietly)*  
I mean, I ate the saved slices, so...

**MR. PRESTON & MR. BRAD** *(simultaneously)*  
NOT NOW, JOEYSON!

**DAN**  
Should we stop them?

**MEREMIAH**  
I kind of want to see where this goes.

**MR. BRAD** *(pulling out more string)*  
You know what the REAL problem is? You're a pessimist! You expect things to go wrong, so they DO!

**MR. PRESTON**  
And YOU'RE too optimistic! You tempt fate with your reckless positivity!

**BELLO** *(finally stepping in)*  
OKAY! ENOUGH!

*Everyone freezes.*

**BELLO**  
Neither of you jinxed anything! Sometimes crazy stuff just HAPPENS! Yannaris has always been weird, Joeyson loves pizza too much, and Dan made a questionable decision inviting Ms. Random!

**DAN**  
Hey!

**BELLO**  
The point is - none of this is because someone said something optimistic OR pessimistic! It's just... December being December!

**RITA**  
He's right. This is just how the holidays go sometimes.

**GOOMO**  
Chaotic and unpredictable.

**NATALIE**  
But ultimately still fun?

*MR. PRESTON and MR. BRAD look at each other, then at their elaborate conspiracy board.*

**MR. PRESTON** *(sheepishly)*  
I... may have gotten a little carried away.

**MR. BRAD**  
Yeah, same here. Sorry for saying you jinxed us.

**MR. PRESTON**  
And I'm sorry for blaming your optimism.

*They shake hands.*

**MR. HOLT**  
So are we finally making those pancakes?

**EVERYONE**  
YES!

**MINA**  
But we're keeping the conspiracy board. It's kind of a work of art.

**MAY**  
We should take a picture of it for the memories.

*Everyone laughs and finally gets to work on breakfast.*

One more day!

I can barely wait!

**DAN**  
This has been the best December ever.

**NOT JEREMIAH**  
Even with the Yannaris incident?

**EVERYONE**  
ESPECIALLY with the Yannaris incident!

*Laughter fills the room.*

Alright everyone, let's get some sleep. Big day tomorrow!

Do you think everyone's still asleep?

**BELLO** *(opening the door)*  
Merry Christmas, guys!

**DAN**  
Merry Christmas! We brought breakfast pastries!

**NOT JEREMIAH**  
And coffee!

**MEREMIAH**  
Figured we'd need it after last night's late bedtime.

**JOEYSON** *(eyeing the pastries)*  
I promise not to eat anyone else's this time.

**RITA**  
We're holding you to that!

*Everyone settles around the tree. Presents are piled high.*

**GOOMO**  
So... who goes first?

**MARIA**  
Youngest to oldest?

**NATALIE**  
That means May and Maria start!

---

**PRESENT OPENING SEQUENCE**

*Warm, gentle music plays as everyone takes turns opening presents.*

**MAY** *(opening a present)*  
Oh wow! Art supplies! This is perfect!

A new journal! Thank you, thank you!

Guess we know what I'm making next year!

**THE KOOPLER CREW'S PRESENTS**

**DAN** *(opening his gift)*  
A new gaming headset! Yes!

**NOT JEREMIAH**  
Music sheets! You guys know me too well!

**MEREMIAH** *(opening his)*  
A... pizza saver? *(holds up a small plastic table)* So the pizza doesn't get squished!

**EVERYONE**  
Perfect!

**JOEYSON** *(opening his last)*  
Wait... what's this?

*He pulls out a lock box with a note: "FOR EMERGENCY PIZZA ONLY - REQUIRES EVERYONE'S PERMISSION TO OPEN"*

**JOEYSON** *(laughing)*  
Okay, I deserved that!

*Everyone bursts into laughter.*

---

## **INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT MORNING**

*Everyone is now wearing their ugly Christmas sweaters, sitting around surrounded by wrapping paper, eating pastries and drinking coffee/hot cocoa.*

**BELLO**  
You know... this has been one of the best Christmases I can remember.

**RITA**  
Even with all the chaos?

**GOOMO**  
Especially because of the chaos!

**MINA**  
The preparation, the snow, the pizza palooza...

**NATALIE**  
The Yannaris incident...

**EVERYONE**  
We don't talk about that!

*Laughter.*

**MARIA**  
I'm just glad we're all here together.

**MAY**  
Same. This is what Christmas is all about.

**DAN**  
Friends, family, and...

**JOEYSON**  
Pizza?

**MEREMIAH**  
He's not wrong!

*More laughter.*

**BELLO** *(standing up with his mug)*  
A toast! To friends, to family, to chaotic Decembers, and to many more Christmases together!

**EVERYONE** *(raising their mugs)*  
Cheers!

*They clink mugs together. The camera slowly pulls back, showing the entire group in their ugly sweaters, surrounded by presents and wrapping paper, the Christmas tree glowing behind them, snow falling outside the window.*

**BELLO** *(voiceover as the camera pulls back)*  
Merry Christmas, everyone.
