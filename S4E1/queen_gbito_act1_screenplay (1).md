## ACT I

FADE IN:

### EXT. QUEEN GBITO.'S CASTLE - DAY

A grand castle sits against an overcast sky. The stone walls are imposing but elegant. Everything is still and quiet.

Too quiet.

### INT. QUEEN GBITO.'S CASTLE - MAIN HALL - DAY

QUEEN GBITO., wearing casual royal attire, sits slumped in an armchair near a window. Her eyes are glazed over, staring at nothing. Her fingers tap restlessly on the armrest.

TWO ROBOTS stand nearby—practical, boxy machines that have clearly been with her for some time. They observe her with what might be concern.

**ROBOT ONE**  
Your Majesty, is everything alright?

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
*(sighs deeply)*  
I'm *bored*. Completely and utterly bored.

**ROBOT TWO**  
Perhaps we could prepare your favorite activities? Music? Reading?

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
*(waves hand dismissively)*  
Tried that. Tried everything. Nothing works. I can't focus on anything.

She stands abruptly and begins pacing.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
I need to... I don't know. Do something. *Anything*.

**ROBOT ONE**  
Perhaps some food might help?

Queen GBito. pauses, considering.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
You know what? Yeah. I'll make myself some mac and cheese.

She heads toward the kitchen.

### INT. QUEEN GBITO.'S CASTLE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Queen GBito. enters the massive royal kitchen. It's state-of-the-art, with gleaming counters and countless gadgets. She opens a cabinet and pulls out a box of mac and cheese.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
*(to herself)*  
Comfort food. That'll help.

She barely glances at the instructions on the back of the box, skimming over them with half-focused eyes.

### MONTAGE - MAKING MAC AND CHEESE

- Queen GBito. fills a pot with water, not measuring, just eyeballing it.
- She dumps in the pasta without waiting for the water to boil.
- She walks away, distracted, scrolling through her phone.
- The water boils over, hissing on the stovetop.
- She rushes back, drains the pasta haphazardly.
- She dumps in butter—too much—and powder cheese—too little.
- She stirs it together carelessly, the mixture clumpy and uneven.

### BACK TO SCENE

Queen GBito. carries her bowl to the kitchen island and sits down. She picks up a fork, twirls some mac and cheese onto it, and takes a bite.

Her face immediately contorts in disgust.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
Ugh! What the—

She spits it back into the bowl, staring at the mess she's created.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
It tastes like... like sadness and disappointment had a baby.

She pushes the bowl away, letting her head fall onto the counter with a *thunk*.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
*(muffled)*  
Even my mac and cheese hates me.

A long beat of silence.

Then, slowly, she lifts her head. Something sparks in her eyes—a flicker of determination.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
You know what? No. I'm not going to just sit here feeling sorry for myself.

She stands, brushing crumbs off her robes.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
I need a *project*. Something challenging. Something... revolutionary.

She pulls out her laptop and opens it on the counter.

### INT. QUEEN GBITO.'S PALACE - KITCHEN - LATER

Queen GBito. is hunched over her laptop, typing rapidly. The screen glows in front of her. She's pulled up a website:

**"INTERPLANETARY INSTITUTE OF ADVANCED ENGINEERING - APPLICATIONS NOW OPEN"**

She scrolls through the requirements:

- Master's degree in Engineering or related field
- PhD preferred
- Portfolio of previous projects
- Letters of recommendation

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
*(muttering)*  
PhD. Right. I can work with that.

She clicks on a new tab and begins typing into a document generator. The screen fills with impressive-sounding credentials:

**"Dr. GBito., PhD in Robotics and AI Systems, Jammbo University"**

She grins, clearly pleased with herself.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
They don't need to know Jammbo University doesn't have a robotics program.

She attaches the fake credentials to her application, adds a fabricated portfolio (pulled from various open-source projects online), and hovers her cursor over the SUBMIT button.

A moment of hesitation.

Then she clicks.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
*(leaning back)*  
There. Done. Now we wait.

She closes the laptop and looks around the kitchen, her eyes landing on the abandoned bowl of terrible mac and cheese.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
You know what? Maybe I don't need to rely on recipes. Maybe I don't need to rely on *anything*.

A dangerous gleam enters her eyes.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
Maybe I can just... build something that does it all for me.

### INT. QUEEN GBITO.'S PALACE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Queen GBito. lies in bed, staring at the ceiling. Her mind races with possibilities. Blueprints and equations float through her imagination.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
*(voiceover, thoughtful)*  
A robot. Not just any robot. Something smarter. Something that can think ahead. Anticipate needs.

She sits up suddenly, grabbing a notebook from her nightstand. She begins sketching frantically.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
*(voiceover)*  
But how do you make something smart enough to help... without making it *too* smart?

She scribbles the word "QUASI-AWARENESS" in big letters, underlining it three times.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
*(whispering to herself)*  
Quasi-awareness. Just enough autonomy to be useful. Not enough to be dangerous.

She smiles, satisfied.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
Perfect.

### INT. QUEEN GBITO.'S PALACE - KITCHEN - MORNING

Queen GBito. sits at the kitchen island, her laptop open again. An email notification pops up:

**"CONGRATULATIONS! You have been accepted into the Interplanetary Institute of Advanced Engineering."**

Her eyes widen in shock, then delight.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
No way. They actually... they accepted me?

She laughs, a mix of disbelief and triumph.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
I mean, of course they did. I'm a queen. And apparently, a doctor now.

She clicks through the welcome materials, scanning course descriptions:

- Introduction to AI Systems
- Neural Network Architecture
- Ethics in Robotics (she skips past this one quickly)
- Advanced Machine Learning

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
Okay. This is happening. This is really happening.

She closes the laptop decisively and stands.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
Time to get to work.

### MONTAGE - QUEEN GBITO. STUDIES AND DESIGNS

**A) INT. QUEEN GBITO.'S PALACE - STUDY - DAY**

Queen GBito. surrounded by textbooks and digital tablets, scribbling notes furiously. Complex equations fill the pages.

**B) INT. QUEEN GBITO.'S PALACE - WORKSHOP - NIGHT**

She's at a workbench, soldering circuit boards, testing sensors, building components piece by piece.

**C) INT. QUEEN GBITO.'S PALACE - BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT**

She's in bed with her laptop, watching tutorial videos at 2x speed, nodding along.

**D) INT. QUEEN GBITO.'S PALACE - KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING**

She makes coffee (badly), spills it on her blueprints, curses, keeps working anyway.

**E) INT. QUEEN GBITO.'S PALACE - WORKSHOP - DAY**

She's assembling a humanoid frame, connecting servo motors and processors. The robot begins to take shape.

**F) INT. QUEEN GBITO.'S PALACE - STUDY - NIGHT**

She reads an article on her screen: "Quasi-Awareness in AI: The Sweet Spot Between Tool and Consciousness."

She highlights a passage:

*"By limiting self-reflection while maintaining goal-oriented behavior, quasi-aware systems can perform complex tasks without the ethical complications of true sentience."*

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
*(nodding)*  
Exactly. No sentience, no problems.

### INT. QUEEN GBITO.'S PALACE - WORKSHOP - WEEKS LATER - DAY

The workshop is a mess—tools scattered everywhere, empty coffee cups stacked in towers, blueprint pages covering every surface.

But in the center of it all stands THE ROBOT.

It's humanoid, sleek, with smooth metallic plating and glowing optical sensors. Its design is elegant but utilitarian. It stands perfectly still, waiting.

Queen GBito. circles it slowly, admiring her work. Pride radiates from her.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
*(softly)*  
Look at you. You're... you're perfect.

She reaches out and touches its shoulder. The metal is cool and smooth.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
You're going to change everything. No more boring days. No more terrible mac and cheese. You'll handle it all.

She steps back, hands on her hips.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
*(louder, to herself)*  
This is it. This is what I've been missing. Purpose. Innovation. *Genius.*

Behind her, the workshop door slides open.

Three of her PREVIOUS ROBOTS enter—older models, boxy and practical. They're led by UNIT-12, a square-shaped robot with a single optical sensor.

**UNIT-12**  
Your Majesty, we'd like to discuss the new unit.

Queen GBito. turns, her expression immediately cooling.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
What about it?

**UNIT-12**  
We've analyzed its code. There are... concerns.

**ROBOT-08**  
*(a tall, cylindrical robot)*  
The quasi-awareness parameters are unstable. It needs extensive testing before—

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
*(cutting them off)*  
Before *what*? Before I decide what to do with *my* creation?

**UNIT-12**  
Your Majesty, we only want to ensure safety. If this robot is released to the public without proper testing—

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
*(voice rising)*  
*If*? You think I don't know what I'm doing?

**ROBOT-08**  
We're not questioning your abilities. We're simply suggesting caution.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
I don't need caution. I need results.

The robots exchange glances—or would, if they had faces capable of expressing concern.

**UNIT-12**  
With respect, Your Majesty, we've seen what happens when AI systems are rushed. The consequences—

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
*(exploding)*  
Enough! I don't want to hear it!

She points at the door.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
Get out. All of you. Now.

**UNIT-12**  
Your Majesty, please—

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
*OUT!*

The robots hesitate for a moment, then slowly file out of the workshop. Unit-12 is the last to leave, pausing in the doorway.

**UNIT-12**  
*(quietly)*  
We hope you know what you're doing.

The door slides shut.

Queen GBito. stands alone with her new robot, breathing heavily. Her anger slowly fades, replaced by a steely determination.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
*(to the robot)*  
They don't understand. They're too cautious. Too afraid.

She walks to her computer and begins typing.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
But I'm not afraid. I'm going to test you myself. Over and over until you're *perfect*.

She initiates a diagnostic program. The robot's eyes flicker to life, glowing brighter.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
*(smiling)*  
Let's begin.

FADE TO:

### TITLE CARD:

**"SEVERAL DAYS LATER"**

### INT. QUEEN GBITO.'S PALACE - WORKSHOP - NIGHT

The workshop is even messier now. Queen GBito. looks exhausted—her hair disheveled, dark circles under her eyes. But her expression is triumphant.

On her computer screen, rows of test results scroll past. All green checkmarks.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
*(exhausted but elated)*  
Finally. *Finally.*

She turns to the robot.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
You're ready. I know you are.

The robot's optical sensors glow steadily, casting a soft blue light across her face.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
Tomorrow, we do the real test. The simulation.

She saves her work and powers down the lab equipment.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
*(to herself)*  
This is it. This is going to work.

She leaves the workshop, the robot standing alone in the darkness.

Its eyes continue to glow, unblinking.

FADE TO BLACK.
