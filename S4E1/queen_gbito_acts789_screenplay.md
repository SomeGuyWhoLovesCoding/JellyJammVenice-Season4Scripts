## ACTS VII-IX

### EXT. SMALL CITY - STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Mr. Brad kneels beside the unconscious Queen GBito., checking her pulse. The other Jammbonians gather around, their faces filled with guilt and fear.

**MR. BRAD**  
*(into comms)*  
Where's that ambulance?!

**VOICE ON COMMS**  
Two minutes out!

Yannaris kneels on the other side of Queen GBito., looking at her injuries.

**YANNARIS**  
She took the full force of that energy pulse. I don't know how she's still breathing.

**BELLO**  
*(voice shaking)*  
This is our fault. We pushed her to face it alone.

**MARIA**  
We never even gave her a chance.

Natalie stands further back, arms crossed, face conflicted. She wants to be angry, but she can't anymore.

**NATALIE**  
*(barely audible)*  
I was so ready to hate her. And I never even knew her.

The sound of sirens approaches.

### EXT. SMALL CITY - STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

An ambulance arrives. PARAMEDICS rush out with a stretcher. They quickly assess Queen GBito. and begin loading her onto it.

**PARAMEDIC 1**  
Severe trauma to the chest and head. Possible internal bleeding. We need to move now.

**MR. BRAD**  
Which hospital?

**PARAMEDIC 2**  
Central Medical. We're taking her straight to surgery prep.

The paramedics load Queen GBito. into the ambulance. The doors slam shut.

The Jammbonians watch as the ambulance pulls away, sirens wailing.

A long moment of silence.

**GOOMO**  
What do we do now?

**RITA**  
We wait. And we hope she makes it.

### INT. AMBULANCE - MOVING - CONTINUOUS

Inside the ambulance, the paramedics work frantically over Queen GBito. Monitors beep erratically. Her breathing is shallow.

**PARAMEDIC 1**  
BP dropping. She's crashing!

**PARAMEDIC 2**  
*(starting chest compressions)*  
Come on, stay with us!

The monitor flatlines for a moment, then begins beeping again, weak but steady.

**PARAMEDIC 1**  
We've got her back. But barely.

The camera slowly pushes in on Queen GBito.'s face. Her eyes remain closed. Her breathing is barely visible.

The sounds of the ambulance—the sirens, the beeping monitors, the paramedics' voices—begin to fade.

Everything goes quiet.

### FADE TO BLACK

Complete darkness. Complete silence.

The black screen holds for several long seconds.

Then, very slowly, almost imperceptibly, a dim grey light begins to seep in from the edges.

### FADE IN - EXTREMELY SLOWLY:

### EXT. PURGATORY - TIMELESS

The world materializes like fog clearing. Everything is grey. Not dark, not light—just grey. The ground is smooth, featureless stone that extends in all directions. The sky is an endless expanse of the same grey, with no sun, no clouds, nothing.

There is no wind. No sound. Just emptiness.

QUEEN GBITO. lies on the ground, motionless.

Slowly—so slowly—her eyes open.

She stares up at the grey sky, confused.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
*(weakly)*  
What...?

She tries to sit up. Her body aches, but differently than before. Less sharp. More distant.

She manages to push herself into a sitting position and looks around.

Nothing. Just grey emptiness in every direction.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
Where... where am I?

She stands, unsteady. She touches her face—the injuries are gone. She checks her stomach where the robot struck her. No pain. No blood.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
*(dawning horror)*  
No. No, this can't be...

She spins around, searching for anything—any landmark, any sign of life.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
*(calling out)*  
Hello?! Is anyone there?!

Her voice echoes slightly, but there's no response.

She starts walking. The landscape doesn't change. Just endless grey stone, endless grey sky.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
This isn't real. This is... I'm unconscious. I'm in the ambulance. I have to be.

She pinches herself. Feels it, but distantly.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
Wake up. Wake up!

Nothing changes.

She continues walking, faster now, almost running.

Then, in the distance, she sees something.

A shape.

She runs toward it.

As she gets closer, it resolves into a STATUE. A figure carved from the same grey stone as the ground, but clearly intentional. Clearly sculpted.

The statue depicts a man in a heroic pose, one hand raised as if reaching for something. The detail is incredible—every fold of clothing, every strand of hair perfectly rendered.

At the base of the statue, an inscription:

**"MICHAEL JAMES - BELOVED BROTHER, FRIEND, PROTECTOR"**

Queen GBito. stares at the name.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
Michael James...?

She's heard the name before. Somewhere. A long time ago.

**VOICE**  
*(from behind)*  
You know of him?

Queen GBito. spins around.

Two figures stand there—a MAN and a WOMAN, both middle-aged, dressed in simple, timeless clothing. They look kind, but weary. Sad.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
Who... who are you?

**THE WOMAN**  
We are the parents of NCTEJ=7/.

Queen GBito.'s eyes widen.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
NCTEJ=7/... I've heard that designation. But I don't...

**THE MAN**  
Few do. Our child was... unique. As were we, in life.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
In life. Then you're...

**THE WOMAN**  
Dead, yes. As are you, in a sense.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
*(shaking her head)*  
No. No, I can't be dead. I was just in the ambulance. They were working on me. I felt them—

**THE MAN**  
You're not fully dead. Not yet. You're in between. Purgatory. A place for those who are deciding.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
Deciding what?

**THE WOMAN**  
Whether to continue. Whether to return. Or whether to let go.

Queen GBito. looks around at the endless grey.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
I don't want to be here. I need to go back. The robot—I have to stop it. I have to fix what I did.

**THE MAN**  
The robot has been stopped. Your friend Yannaris saw to that, though it cost him dearly.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
But I... I caused all of this. All that destruction. All those people—

**THE WOMAN**  
You made a mistake. A terrible one.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
*(voice breaking)*  
I was so arrogant. I thought I knew better than everyone. I ignored warnings. I pushed too hard, too fast. And now...

She sinks to her knees.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
Now people are hurt. The city is destroyed. And those people—the Jammbonians—they finally met me, and all I brought them was disaster.

**THE MAN**  
They met you. And they learned something about themselves.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
What could they possibly have learned? That I'm dangerous? That they were right to hate me from a distance?

**THE WOMAN**  
That hatred from a distance is still hatred. That judgment without understanding creates suffering. And that perhaps, they bear some responsibility too.

Queen GBito. looks up at them.

**THE WOMAN** *(CONT'D)*  
You were wrong. But so were they. And now, all of you have a choice. To continue that cycle, or to break it.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
I don't know if I can face them. After everything.

**THE MAN**  
That is your decision. You can stay here, where there is no judgment, no pain. Or you can return and face what you've done.

Queen GBito. looks at the statue of Michael James again.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
Who was he? Really?

**THE WOMAN**  
A man who tried to do good and made mistakes. A man who faced consequences. A man who kept trying anyway.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
Did he... did he succeed?

**THE MAN**  
That depends on how you measure success. He's remembered. He's honored. But he's also gone.

Queen GBito. stands slowly.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
I don't want to be remembered as the queen who created a monster and then ran away. I don't want to be a cautionary tale.

**THE WOMAN**  
Then what do you want?

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
*(quietly, but with growing conviction)*  
I want to go back. I want to face what I did. I want to apologize—really apologize, not just say words. I want to rebuild. I want to do better.

**THE MAN**  
That will be difficult. Painful.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
I know. But staying here would be worse.

**THE WOMAN**  
*(smiling softly)*  
Then you've made your choice.

The grey world begins to brighten, slowly.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
What's happening?

**THE MAN**  
You're returning. Your body is still fighting. And now, your spirit is too.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
Wait—will I see you again?

**THE WOMAN**  
Perhaps. But hopefully not soon.

The light grows brighter, overwhelming the grey.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
Thank you. For listening. For not judging me.

**THE MAN**  
We are not here to judge. Only to witness.

The light becomes blinding white.

### FADE TO WHITE

The sound of beeping. Faint at first, then louder.

The white light begins to resolve into shapes. Ceiling tiles. Fluorescent lights.

Voices, muffled, becoming clearer.

**VOICE 1**  
—pressure stabilizing—

**VOICE 2**  
—she's coming back—

### INT. HOSPITAL - AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY

Wait, not an autopsy room. An OPERATING ROOM.

Queen GBito.'s eyes flutter open. Everything is blurry. White walls. Bright lights. Figures in surgical masks moving around her.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
*(slurred, confused)*  
Where...?

One of the figures leans over her. The surgical mask covers most of their face, but the eyes are kind.

**SURGEON ARTHUR**  
Your Majesty. You're awake. You're in surgery prep at Central Medical.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
Surgery? What happened? The robot—

**SURGEON ARTHUR**  
The robot has been secured by police. You're safe now. But you've sustained serious injuries. We need to operate immediately.

Queen GBito. tries to sit up, but she can't. Restraints? No—weakness. Her body won't respond.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
How long... how long was I out?

**SURGEON ARTHUR**  
Minutes. You flatlined in the ambulance, but the paramedics revived you. You've been unconscious since.

*Minutes?* It felt like hours in that grey place.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
The people. The Jammbonians. Are they—

**SURGEON ARTHUR**  
No casualties reported. Property damage, yes. But everyone survived.

Queen GBito. closes her eyes, relief flooding through her.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
Thank god.

**SURGEON ARTHUR**  
Your Majesty, I need to ask you some questions before we proceed. Can you tell me your full name?

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
Queen GBito.

**SURGEON ARTHUR**  
Do you know where you are?

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
Central Medical. You just told me.

**SURGEON ARTHUR**  
Good. Do you remember what happened?

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
*(voice tight)*  
All of it. Every terrible second.

**SURGEON ARTHUR**  
I'm going to administer anesthesia now. When you wake up, the surgery will be complete.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
Wait—

**SURGEON ARTHUR**  
Yes?

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
The robot. What's happening to it?

**SURGEON ARTHUR**  
I don't have all the details, but I understand it's been powered down and is being held as evidence.

He prepares a syringe, tapping it to remove air bubbles.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
Evidence. Right. I'll probably face charges.

**SURGEON ARTHUR**  
That's for others to decide. Right now, your job is to heal.

He brings the syringe to her IV line.

**SURGEON ARTHUR** *(CONT'D)*  
Count backwards from ten for me.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
Ten... nine... eight...

Behind Surgeon Arthur, a television mounted on the wall flickers to life. The NEWS.

A REPORTER stands in front of the destroyed city streets.

**REPORTER** *(on TV)*  
—devastating attack by a rogue AI has left the downtown area in ruins. The robot, created by Queen GBito., went on a rampage this afternoon, destroying property and causing widespread panic—

Queen GBito.'s eyes stay fixed on the screen as her vision begins to blur.

**REPORTER** *(CONT'D, on TV)*  
—the robot has now been confiscated by police and is being held in a secure facility. Authorities are investigating the incident and considering potential charges against the robot's creator—

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
*(barely conscious)*  
Seven... six...

**REPORTER** *(CONT'D, on TV)*  
—while there were no fatalities, the emotional and economic impact on this community will be felt for years to come—

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
Five... four...

Her eyes close.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
*(whispered)*  
I'm sorry...

The world goes dark again.

### FADE TO BLACK

### INT. HOSPITAL - RECOVERY ROOM - LATER

Soft beeping. Gentle light filtering through curtains.

Queen GBito.'s eyes open slowly. She's in a different room now—quieter, calmer. A recovery room.

She's alone.

She looks down at herself. Bandages. IV lines. Monitors.

But she's alive.

She stares at the ceiling for a long moment.

Then, quietly, she begins to cry.

Not from pain. Not from fear.

From relief. From shame. From the weight of everything she's done and everything she has yet to face.

Outside the window, the sun is setting. The day is ending.

But she's still here.

### FADE TO:

### INT. HOSPITAL - RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT

Hours have passed. Queen GBito. lies awake, staring at the darkened ceiling.

She's been thinking. About the robot. About the Jammbonians. About Yannaris sacrificing his home. About those two souls in Purgatory.

About what comes next.

A NURSE enters quietly.

**NURSE**  
Your Majesty. How are you feeling?

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
Like I got hit by my own creation.

The nurse checks her vitals, adjusting the IV.

**NURSE**  
The surgery went well. You'll need to rest for several days, but you should make a full recovery.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
That's good news. I have a lot to do.

**NURSE**  
The doctor wants you to rest—

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
I will. But after I rest, there's work to do. Apologizing. Rebuilding. Making things right.

The nurse smiles slightly.

**NURSE**  
One step at a time, Your Majesty.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
One step at a time.

The nurse leaves. Queen GBito. is alone again.

She closes her eyes, but this time, not to escape.

To prepare.

### INT. HOSPITAL - RECOVERY ROOM - SEVERAL DAYS LATER - DAY

Queen GBito. sits up in bed, looking much better. The bandages have been reduced. She's eating solid food.

The door opens. SURGEON ARTHUR enters.

**SURGEON ARTHUR**  
Good morning, Your Majesty. I have good news. You're cleared for discharge.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
Really? That's sooner than I expected.

**SURGEON ARTHUR**  
Your recovery has been remarkable. You'll need to take it easy for a few more weeks, but you can go home.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
Home. Right.

She thinks about her castle. The destroyed workshop. The hole in the wall.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
Actually, before I go... is there any way I could get access to a computer? I need to look something up.

**SURGEON ARTHUR**  
Of course. I'll have someone bring one in.

### INT. HOSPITAL - RECOVERY ROOM - LATER

Queen GBito. sits with a laptop, typing slowly. She's researching. Reading articles about the incident. Comments from the Jammbonians. Damage assessments.

She's taking it all in. Not hiding from it.

Then she opens a new document and begins to type.

**"To the Jammbonians..."**

She pauses, considering her words carefully.

Then she continues writing.

### FADE TO:

### INT. QUEEN GBITO.'S CASTLE - KITCHEN - DAY

Queen GBito. stands in her kitchen, fully recovered now. Weeks have passed.

She's different somehow. More grounded. More careful.

On the counter sits a box of mac and cheese.

She picks it up and actually reads the instructions. Really reads them. Every word.

She measures the water precisely. She waits for it to boil properly. She sets a timer for the pasta.

While it cooks, her TWO ROBOTS—the ones she kicked out—enter hesitantly.

**ROBOT ONE**  
Your Majesty. We... we heard you were back.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
*(turning to face them)*  
I owe you both an apology. A real one.

The robots seem surprised.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
You warned me. You told me the new robot wasn't ready. And I didn't just ignore you—I kicked you out for caring.

**ROBOT TWO**  
Your Majesty—

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
I was arrogant. I thought I knew better than everyone. And I was wrong. Catastrophically wrong.

She turns back to the stove, stirring the pasta.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
I've spent the last few weeks thinking about what drives me. And I realized something. I was bored. So bored that I couldn't focus. And instead of dealing with that boredom in a healthy way, I created something dangerous just to feel excited again.

The timer dings. She drains the pasta carefully.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
But I've learned something. Work—real, honest, focused work—can be its own kind of fulfillment. It doesn't have to be revolutionary or dangerous to matter.

She adds the butter and cheese powder, measuring each carefully. She stirs it together, creating a smooth, creamy mixture.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
Sometimes, the most important thing you can do is make a decent bowl of mac and cheese.

She takes a bite.

It's perfect. Creamy, flavorful, exactly right.

She smiles—genuinely smiles—for the first time in what feels like forever.

**QUEEN GBITO.** *(CONT'D)*  
Would you like to join me?

**ROBOT ONE**  
We don't eat, Your Majesty.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
Right. Of course. But... would you like to stay anyway?

The robots look at each other, then back at her.

**ROBOT TWO**  
We would be honored.

She gets three bowls—one for her, two empty ones for them as a gesture—and they sit together at the kitchen table.

She raises her spoon in a toast.

**QUEEN GBITO.**  
To doing better. To learning. To actually reading the instructions.

**ROBOT ONE**  
*(attempting humor)*  
To reading the instructions.

They "clink" spoons—hers against their empty bowls.

She eats her mac and cheese in peace.

It tastes like redemption.

### EXT. JAMMBONIANS' OLD HOUSE - DAY

Meanwhile, across town, the Jammbonians are loading up their cars. BELLO carries boxes, GOOMO ties down furniture, RITA and MINA pack the last of their belongings.

**BELLO**  
Is that everything?

**GOOMO**  
I think so. Maria, May, you got the kitchen stuff?

**MARIA**  
All packed!

**MAY**  
We're ready!

They've decided to move. Too many bad memories in this place. Too much destruction nearby. Time for a fresh start.

NATALIE stands by RITA's car, quiet. She's been quiet for weeks.

**RITA**  
*(approaching Natalie)*  
You okay?

**NATALIE**  
I keep thinking about her. Queen GBito.

**RITA**  
What about her?

**NATALIE**  
I was so ready to hate her. And then we finally met her, and she was just... a person. Making mistakes. Trying to fix them.

**RITA**  
We all were. Ready to hate her, I mean.

**NATALIE**  
Do you think she's okay?

**RITA**  
I heard she recovered. Got out of the hospital a few weeks ago.

**NATALIE**  
I should... I don't know. Apologize? We weren't exactly kind.

**RITA**  
None of us were.

BELLO calls out from the lead car.

**BELLO**  
Everyone ready? Let's go meet the owner of the new place!

The Jammbonians pile into their cars. All except Natalie, who gets into Rita's car.

**NATALIE**  
*(to Rita)*  
Thanks for letting me ride with you.

**RITA**  
Of course. You know I love you, right?

**NATALIE**  
*(small smile)*  
I know.

The caravan of cars pulls out, heading toward their new home.

Toward a fresh start.

### EXT. NEW HOUSE - DAY

The cars arrive at a beautiful new house—bigger, brighter, in a safer neighborhood.

The OWNER, a friendly middle-aged person, stands on the porch waiting.

**OWNER**  
Welcome! Welcome! You must be the Jammbonians!

**BELLO**  
*(getting out of the car)*  
That's us!

**OWNER**  
Come on in! Let me show you around!

The Jammbonians eagerly follow the owner inside.

All except Natalie, who hangs back, looking at Rita.

**NATALIE**  
Do you think we'll be happy here?

**RITA**  
I think we'll try to be. And sometimes, that's enough.

They head inside together.

### INT. NEW HOUSE - DAY

The house is beautiful. Open, bright, full of potential.

The Jammbonians explore, exclaiming over rooms, claiming spaces.

**MAY**  
This is perfect!

**MARIA**  
So much better than the old place!

**MINA**  
We can really start fresh here!

They're smiling. Laughing. Moving forward.

But there's still a weight. A shared understanding that they all learned something difficult about themselves. About judgment. About hatred from a distance.

They'll carry that lesson with them.

### EXT. NEW HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY

As the Jammbonians settle in, NATALIE stands outside Rita's car, reluctant to fully join the celebration.

Rita comes back out.

**RITA**  
You coming?

**NATALIE**  
In a minute.

Rita nods and goes back inside.

Natalie looks up at the sky.

**NATALIE**  
*(quietly)*  
I hope you're doing okay, Queen GBito. Wherever you are.

A beat.

Then she turns and heads inside to join her friends.

The camera holds on the empty driveway for a moment.

Then pulls back, rising up to show the new house, the neighborhood, the city beyond.

Life goes on.

People learn. People grow. People try to do better.

### FADE TO BLACK.
