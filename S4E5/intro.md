# INT. CITY - EMPTY STREET

### Bello
Oh. Is this...the US economy right now!?
### Goomo
I think so, yeah-
### Rita
OH NO!!! WE MUST RUN OFF OF HERE BEFORE THE REINCARNATION OF SATAN COMES IN UNTIL THEY FILL UP THEIR STOCKS WITH GOLD AGAIN!
### Mina
Rita, no!
### Natalie
Let's just wait, cuz I don't have all day for this.
### Mr. Holt
It's best to wait [here]().
### Mr. Preston
NOT NOW-
### Mr. Holt
Hey! Where the fuck did you come from!?
### Mr. Preston
I thought we were still friends buddy come on-
### Mr. Holt
No, seriously, where did you come from!? I thought you flew off to Spain by now-
### Bello, Goomo, and Rita
We were all going to Spain but they shut down due to THE government shutdown, so, yeah, that is that.
### Mr. Preston
OH MY FUCKING GOD IF DID THEY ROSE UP THE PRICES FOR WATERMELON AND WALNUTS I'M GONNA POP MY HEAD WITH THESE FINGERS HERE CUZ I'M DONE WITH EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!
### Natalie
Bro, chill out, we're gonna find a place to stay, okay?
### Mr. Holt
Preston's obviously pissed off right now, so I'd suggest that you leave him alone.
### Mr. Brad
Sup, boys!
### Bello
The fucking economy just shut down!
### Mr. Brad
*(scared)* Oh no! Is that...true???
### Bello
Yeah the fuck it is and you should go look at the outwest global news network right now!
### Goomo
Let's just watch, cuz I'm not doing this no more!
### Rita
Hey, I wanna see!
### Mina
Shut the fuck up, let me see!!!!!
### Natalie
Oh no... Is that the US detonating the tiniest bomb in the world right now...?
### Salty
Uh oh! I think we're screwed...
### Bob
It's the tiniest bomb in the world what's the big deal?

### Newsman
Hello there. This is James Continential Fire here, and today, we're back on a reboot session!
### Newsman (CONT.)
Because we just got an alert all around the world that the US economy has dropped SEVERELY!

---
### Bello
Oh my fucking god. Is that true!? I thought only shut down.
### Rita
THAT MEANS WE CAN NO LONGER PAY FOR ANYTHING!!!
### Mina
THE FUCKING US GOVERNMENT HAS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS OR THE WHOLE STATE WILL BE NUKED!!!
### Natalie
Guys stop being so dramatic, let's find who could've caused this or else-
### Mr. Brad
Don't bring that up...or else...
### Mr. Holt
HELP US PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLESAEPLE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!

---
*The us president comes into play once their screams are heard.*
### President
Oh! is that...

The president is shocked about the economic damage...
### President (CONT.)
Oh no... We're too screwed to live any further... I think we might want to just shut down everything and transport everything, including all of our data in the world, to mars since it's an unhabitable place and it's lighter than earth, for preservation purposes, and just let this war go out...
### Bello
I'm sorry everybody... But... We must travel to Spain...
### Goomo
Yeah it doesn't matter there will be zero bytes of data anywhere anyway—
### President
Oh all of the computer data in the world will have its product ID and company printed out all over each crystal we can find there and we can simply overwrite all of it into a yottabyte storage service we can build on mars just in case, which can last up until the heat death of our universe.
### Rita
Oh really?
### President
Yeah, people have advanced too much due to the meth addiction as they can think far beyond everyone else's innovations...
### President (CONT.)
People have been making random combinations of things and even computers are now 200 trillion times faster and more power efficient now because of this... The world has been crushed by Methocolate 5...
### Mr. Holt
Or is it...
### Bello
Hold on... A Methocolate What!

# FLASHBACKS BEGIN

*Rapid flashbacks begin of the production of Methocolate 1, all the way to Methocolate 4, which is when you realize that the world now depends on methocolates now.*

# BACK TO. CITY - EMPTY STREET

### Bello
I'm scared to even move... There's probably billions of tons of water falling down on us due to a huge tsunami, none like before, just coming down straight to us-
### President
Mr. Funny Man have built a protective wall originally to be a racist son of a gun, but now it's about to be used for defeating 90% of that tsunami!
### Rita
I don't think that wall can handle that... Are you sure about this...?
### President
Oh! Yeah, I'm sure about it. The wall has mineralized over time due to the decrepit rocket launchers that have emitted a unique type of gas nobody has seen...
### President (CONT.)
But hey, on the flipside, we can handle this if we wanted to...
### Bello
But what would happen if the tsunami is just a river prank...?
### Bello (CONT.)
YEAH—I'm changing the topic by now... People have been shocking the world with river pranks so far and all of the criminals were permanently locked for that.
### President
I don't believe that.
### Rita
What the fuck??? You're the current US President!!!
### President
Oh, right, I might have to retire soon, but seriously—
### President (CONT.)
We have to make a global backup service all the way in mars just in case of any nuclear weapons that might be on the loose right now...
### Bello
Why are you so worried? Isn't that like illegal at all, if anything?
### Rita
I don't know, but I think there is a group of people responsible for it, like whatchamacallit...

*Rita thinks for 2 minutes straight while music plays, but it suddenly stops as Goomo interrupts her.*

### Goomo
Zorch Aliens!
### Rita
Wait...what...?
### Bello
Oh no... The fuckheads who had kept away the Sprunki's for investigating on them...
### Bello (CONT.)
What are we gonna do, president!? We can't let this just happen anyway!
### President
Well, we have two options unfortunately...
### President (CONT.)
You can find a random abandoned radio to take to the radio workshop to fix, and try to calibrate it so it's useful for communication, or, you could fly over to Spain.
### Natalie
Why radio?
### President
Well, as it appears, we had started making laws around it since the time it began its way to intergrating to our world, as it's used for when a natural disaster happens and you still want to communicate with someone.
### Rita
Interesting... So a radio is just telephone signals...?
### President
Yep.
### Mr. Holt
Hold up—this doesn't add up, what are we doing here again!?
### President
Oh—we were just checking. Social media is about to almost shut down as part of the great collapse of 2029.
### Bello
Oh.
### Rita
So why did you just come here then?
### President
I was searching for random people and I found YOU guys just standing at the middle of an empty street, which is a perfect spot to be visible.
### Goomo
Cool.
### Mr. Preston
I have to go to work still... I'm like a minute late—lemme just open up this laptop and start preparing my huge project...
### Mr. Holt
Wait, HUGE!?

*We move on to Yannaris and Ms Random, who are witnessing the collapse on their toes, while Victoria talks to them about a sex conference whilst the collapse accelerates.*

# INT. MIDDLE-GROUND BUILDING - THE OFFICE

### Yannaris
We have to wait until we can fix it.
### Ms. Random
Yeah, we didn't know we were being controlled by that Zorch Alien shit, cuz what happens if their plan fully executes!?
### Victoria
Guys, guys, chill out. I have the best plan to stop it.
### Yannaris
Why? That isn't gonna work at all, and I know it.
### Victoria
Well, it will work. So, lemme think for what'll feel like 10 straight years so I can say it out loud in two words.

*Victoria starts ascending like a god, until she completes her innovation.*

### Victoria (CONT.)
World domination 2.
### Yannaris
Just like that!?
### Victoria
Yeah #LAUGH02# I mean, what about it? It's obviously too strong to defeat without saving the city, so...
### Yannaris
Didn't star and the forces of evil already do that shit? And it was poorly executed too—like what the fuck was up wtih their mind!?
### Ms. Random
Well, this time, it's going to be awesome.
### Ms. Random (CONT.)
Explain to me how powerful the Zorch Group is and I can tell you the absolute 100% value.
### Yannaris
They're pathetic for illegally accessing some bitch ass bunker to use as a base for their ultimate master plan.
### Victoria
I don't know actually, let me just think.
### Ms. Random
It's 1 billion drillion the fuckhead of James' misery. It's powerful as hell, and I know it.
### Ms. Random (CONT.)
I've been a victim of them for a LONG time now, as I'm recalling through the last fragments of my memory.
### Yannaris
Damn girl, that's some titan ass shit—how the hell did you come up with that!?
### Ms. Random
I was spying on them...
### Yannaris
Wait...what!?

# INT. FLASHBACKS AGAIN

*Rapid flashbacks begin again, as part of the "former" villains' plan to save the world.*

# BACK TO. MIDDLE-GROUND BUILDING - THE OFFICE

### Ms. Random
We figured it out boys. We did it.
### Yannaris
Just like that!?
### Ms. Random
Yeah, fuck it, let's do it anyway!

*Everyone in the office burst out to steal an abandoned car and hijack it.*

# INT. OUTSIDE OF MIDDLE-GROUND BUILDING - IN ABANDONED CAR

### Victoria
Are you sure about this? Because I think you and Ms. Random were drivin' that shit before, and you know it!
### Yannaris
I was the most pissed by that era, and that's where Jude Kowa finally broke Michael James' law.
### Yannaris (CONT.)
I would've been more pissed if I still even supported him just a tiny little itty bitty bit.
### Ms. Random
Oh. That was my exact dream car.
### Victoria
And it's getting fixed here!?
### Victoria (CONT.)
That doesn't make sense... I mean—what the hell!?
### Yannaris
Let's just drive off here and never ever come back here. This is a shitty spot to park a car—
### Ms. Random
And why the hell do you gotta park it there in the first place—you people!? You dirty filthy assholes!

*Yannaris drives off while Victoria and Ms. Random remain in the back seat.*

*To be continued?*
