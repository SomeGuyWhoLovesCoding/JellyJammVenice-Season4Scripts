### Jelly Jamm ~ Venice: Season 4, Episode 5 (ACT 1)

The Villains revisit Ms Random's dream car

## INT. WALL STREET - SIDEWALK
#### Ms Random
Hmmmmmm... I wonder what is missing from me...
#### Ms Random (CONT.)
Ah hah! My car! My dream car! Yannaris, where is it-
#### Yannaris
Dude-I don't know, okay? Can you please chill out? I'm trying a concentrate here and I'm not allowed to do that shit ever cuz of YOU...
#### Ms Random
Look-I'm sorry, I didn't realize...
#### Yannaris
Look, it's okay, but can you tone it down a bit? Thank you.
#### Ms Random
It all just reminds me of that stupid fucking car that **Jude Kowa**, out of all the people I could've expected, literally just destroyed the hell out of.
#### Victoria
All this talk about car is giving me a very precious idea... Another one, I meant.
#### Victoria (CONT.)
And this time... I will-
#### Ms Random
If you reveal that in public, I will disown you.
#### Victoria
Fine, I guess I'll just keep it in my head for a while...
#### Ms Random
People are shittier than us-we are better-
#### Victoria
Don't you repeat that-
#### Yannaris
Alright, we can't cause a stern here, ya know?
#### Victoria & Ms Random (SIMULTANEOUSLY)
Cool.
#### Yannaris
Alright, now as a result, my mind is now all over that car I just kept remembering myself raging at Jude for...
#### Ms Random
And that moment was the most embarrassing in my whole life, I CRIED for hours just THINKING about that car
#### Yannaris
Ms Random-look!
##
*They see a car exactly like Ms Random's dream car. Ms Random gets estatic about this, resulting in her hugging it.*

## INT. WALL STREET - RESIDENCE A
#### Ms Random
DREAM CAR! MUAH MUAH MUAH MUAH MUAH MUAH MUAH MUAH MUAH MUAH MUAH MUAH-
#### Yannaris
Umm... Is this really your dream car?
#### Ms Random
FUCK YES WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THIS WAS MY CAR I NEED TO DRIVE ON!
#### Victoria
Why do you STILL think that's cool!? Isn't that like from the 1980's!?
#### Ms Random
Yeah, and this is probably the only car remaining to this day that has that exact exotic CAR brand I wanted to talk about since the dawn of the ages.
#### Yannaris
Oh? That brand was banned from the US for being bigger than the other cars, right? Cuz, you know, it's an exotic car nobody would care to see.
#### Ms Random
Yeah. It ran over literal cars and shit, that's why it's special!
#### Victoria
Wait-really?
#### Ms Random
Fuck yeah, what are you talking about?
#### Ms Random (CONT.)
I LOVE KILLING THE ILLEGALS!!!!!!
#### Yannaris
I swear to god, you just said that in public...
#### Ms Random
LET'S DRIVE THIS MOTHERFUCKER-YEAAAAAAAAAAAh!

*Ms Random immediately brings everyone in the car and starts driving recklessly, crashing it onto another residence.*

## INT. WALL STREET - RESIDENCE B (CRASH SCENE)
#### Ms Random
Uh, oh.
#### Ms Random (CONT.)
I can fix it! Just have to take it to a-
#### Yannaris
Oh, no, you're not taking THAT to a goddamn gas station for sure! That car's banned permanently!
#### Victoria
Yeah, what do you expect!? That car's shitty and old, and there are better cars out there, so why not buy a smaller version of this!?
#### Ms Random
Because this is MY car.
#### Ms Random (CONT.)
I love this shit, and you know that. Now, I gotta check it to see if anything broke.

*Ms Random immediately goes to check every spec of the exotic car to see if anything broke out of it. It takes forever.*

#### Ms Random (CONT.)
I swear, I better take this shit to the government, cuz this didn't break at all!
#### Yannaris
Wait, what!?
#### Victoria
You gotta be kidding me...
#### Ms Random
Yeah, I'm not kidding. I checked every spec and the outside isn't broken, MEANING it should still work.
#### Yannaris
Why?
#### Ms Random
Because I love this so goddamn much, you know.
#### Victoria
You should just trade that car and that guy can have it in his banned car collection, if it's the guy.
#### Ms Random
NO, I WANT TO OWN THIS CAR FOR FUN!
#### Yannaris
Damn, girl, stop screaming in public...
#### Victoria
Yeah, you're probably bringing attention to that car, and that car's banned, so-
#### Ms Random
SHUT THE FUCKING FAGGOT UP!
#### Ms Random (CONT.)
Anyway, time to continue this-

*Ms Random continues driving the exotic car that's still not broken.*

*But, she immediately gets pulled over by the cops for crashing it onto a residence.*

#### COP 1
FREEZE!
#### Ms Random
What the fuck do you want from me!?
#### Ms Random (CONT.)
I DON'T TOLERATE ANY OF THIS!
#### COP 2
You're under arrest for containing that car you just stole from us, so let's go to court and talk this out!
#### Ms Random
NO!
#### COP 1
Anything you say or do will be used against you.
#### COP 2
Now get in the police car, you're under arrest!
#### Ms Random
I-
#### COP 1
THAT'S GOING TO BE USED AGAINST YOU!

*The cops force her into the car, handcuffing her as much as possible.*

#### Yannaris
God damnit, what are gonna do!?
#### Victoria
CHASE EM DOWN...!

*Yannaris and Victoria use their existing powers to take down the cop car and throw it off a cliffside.*

## INT. CLIFFSIDE - LAKE

*But, the cops survive, so they throw her in a lake and tell her how long she should stay for, upsetting her.*

#### Ms Random
5...fucking...years...!
#### Ms Random (CONT.)
RRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

*Ms Random passes out in the lake, never appearing again until March 20th 2030. or...is that the case...case...*

## INT. WALL STREET - RESIDENCE C (SHELTER) - LIVING ROOM
#### Bello
Well, we're here now.
#### Goomo
I hate this so much-
#### Rita
Ssh! The cops might be watching us...
#### Mina
I don't WANNA live there!
#### Natalie
Guys, guys, we have tea.
#### Bello
I don't want any tea. No thank you.
#### Natalie
Why not have any tea?
#### Bello
Cuz I want coffee, and that's delicious.
#### Rita
But isn't coffee bad for you?
#### Bello
Rita, I will fuck you up...!
#### Goomo
Bello-stop, calm down! You'll be alright, okay?
#### Bello
But I'm pissed that the government's being shut down for the literal hundredth time!
#### Rita
Government shutdowns aren't uncommon, okay? It can be due to economic issues, or, well, not Obama.
#### Bello
Fuck you Trump, you caused this!
#### Mina
Maybe if it weren't for corporate greed, this wouldn't have happened in the first place!
#### Rita
Look, there are dvd's of adult films that we can watch, okay?
#### Bello
Yeah, good thing I'm not babysittin' right now. They're probably being adopted by someone else, and I don't really care who they are. I just miss them, but you have to let it go...
#### Goomo
Ooh, I remember the time May pissed at the sink!
#### Bello
DO NOT- FFFFFFFFffffffffhh... Man, you piss me off with that!
#### Bello (CONT.)
I don't want nothing to do with May pissing on the sink at 4 years old! That was the most embarrassing thing I have ever witnessed in MY entire life, besides my first boner at Jammbo, you know?
#### Goomo
Hmm?
#### Bello
Exactly. You just wanna SPY on me, is that right?
#### Rita
Goomo, leave Bello alone. I don't think he wants to talk to you right now. We need to stop stressing about May and Maria and just watch the films we want. Hell, they're only half damaged!
#### Bello
Fucking what!?
#### Bello (CONT.)
Alright, that's it, I'm burning these. They're pretty much useless-
#### Mina
TRY THEM FIRST, BEFORE YOU DISPOSE ANY OF THEM!
#### Bello
Whatever, I guess I'll try to see if they're compatible. That's the most important thing.
#### Rita
I thought half damaged was fine for a cd.
#### Bello
Look, you don't do anything with a half-damaged cd! You *repair* it!
#### Mina
That CD's probably defective, okay? Let's throw it out. There are a ton of cracks here, and I don't think you want to ever attempt to play film on that
#### Rita
What CD?
#### Mina
Oops, my bad. It's so dark, let's turn on the light.

*Mina turns on a lamp which only fills in a bit of space.*

#### Mina (*sighing*)
Motherfucker... We just can't get any light, okay?
#### Bello
Well-open a window or something, I don't know.
#### Mina
But there would be too much light.
#### Bello
Alright, so don't fuck with anything in this house. We need to find **food**.
#### Rita
Food.
#### Natalie
Food.
#### Mina
Why?
#### Bello
Cuz I'm gettin' pretty hungry. How about you guys?
#### Rita
I haven't eaten yet. Sorry.
#### Bello
You...fucking what!?
#### Rita
Look-there was no more left in the house, so we had to move out, sell it, and just keep the money just incase the government opens up again!
#### Bello
Oh, well thank you for selling that place. Did you guys bring anything?
#### Goomo
I got a big 466 truck.
#### Bello
Where!?
#### Mina
Oh, well, we brang it to a garage where everything's stored, so like, everything in there is a library.
#### Bello
Fine. But, find the garage when we're done, cuz I don't want anyone stealing it from us!
#### Rita
Okay, well, let's go find some food!
#### Natalie
Hell yeah.

*The Jammbonians find food for everyone. They find t1***36 everywhere.*

## INT. WALL STREET - RESIDENCE C - DINING ROOM

#### Bello
We neeeeeddd.....
#### Goomo
We gotta sort food on the plate this time, just in case.
#### Bello
Yeah, that means no sneaking shit, or we're gonna be out faster. You know what happens when we're out? We'll starve.
#### Rita
Goomo had an obsessive habit of gluttony, and I think he nearly got fat one time and went to a hospital thankfully due to him also drinking energy drinks.
#### Bello
GOOMO, YOU ARE A MOTHERFUCKER FOR THAT!
#### Goomo
Look, I loved energy drinks, okay? I no longer like 'em now.
#### Bello
Cool, now don't fuck with your liver next time!
#### Mina
Yeah, you nearly killed yourself.
#### Natalie
Enough talking. Less filler, more eating. It's time.

*The Jammbonians unhesitantly start searching for food in the shelter's dining room.*

#### Mina
Is that mold under the table?
#### Bello
I don't know... That might just be teal crack.
#### Rita
Don't say that, that's not nice.
#### Bello
But I DON'T know what this is! It might be-

*Bello thinks about the time everyone was sent to College Bus 2 magically with the magic mold under the table.*

#### Bello (CONT.)
Oh no... We're really doomed.
#### Goomo
Don't worry, Bello, I'll always be by your side.
#### Bello
DUDE, DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT YOU'RE ANNOYING THE HECK OUTTA ME NOW!?
#### Goomo
RIGHT.
#### Rita
Exactly.
#### Natalie
We were searching for food, you know?
#### Bello
I don't get it, guys, let's keep searching.
#### Goomo
Impossible. That was all of the food in that one container. Nothing but a small tiny crumb of bread.
#### Bello
Do you think that shit will ever heal us!? No. Now, let's keep searching.
#### Bello (CONT.)
We barely have any time left on earth, and we're still searching!
#### Rita
Goomo, why are you eating those cookies?
#### Goomo
That's the last one. I shared it to everyone, don't worry.
#### Bello
Those cookies don't do fuck to us, so, keep it up and I'll have to kick you out of here!
#### Goomo
Fine.

*The Jammbonians keep searching desperately for any nutritious food, but to no avail.*

#### Mina
Are we really gonna start spending our whole life just sitting here?
#### Bello
No, we'll keep searching. Stop talking, cuz you're gonna waste your breath now, too.

*There's an imminent pause inbetween lines.*

#### Bello (to Mina)
Save it.
