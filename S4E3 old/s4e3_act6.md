## INT. NEW HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

The sun is now fully up. Morning light floods through the windows. The house is quiet except for the soft hum of the TV.

Dan is sprawled out on one couch, his head resting against a pillow. Not Jeremiah is on another couch, one arm hanging over the side. Kelly is curled up in an armchair with a blanket pulled up to her chin. Meremiah is on a third couch, his eyes barely open, staring at nothing in particular.

The TV plays softly in the background. A morning news program. The ANCHOR is discussing weather and local events. None of them are really paying attention. They're all exhausted from the night.

Minutes pass. The news continues. Dan's breathing becomes shallow and regular—he's fully asleep now. Kelly's head tilts to the side. Even Not Jeremiah's eyes close.

Meremiah struggles to keep his eyes open, fighting against the exhaustion pulling him down.

The news transitions to a new segment.

**NEWS ANCHOR** (V.O.)
(on TV)
We're continuing to follow the developing story about the NCTEJ=7/ escape plan that was leaked to multiple news outlets earlier this week. Authorities initially dismissed it as a hoax, but new evidence suggests otherwise.

Meremiah's eyes flutter. He's barely conscious.

**NEWS ANCHOR** (V.O.) (CONT'D)
(on TV)
In an exclusive report, we've learned that NCTEJ=7/ has been using her time in solitary confinement to plan what authorities are calling an "inevitable escape." We'll have more details after this break.

The TV cuts to a commercial.

The door to the living room opens suddenly.

MR. HOLT (50s, weathered, serious) walks in. He's holding a newspaper in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other. He looks like he hasn't slept.

He walks straight to the TV and turns up the volume.

Everyone jolts awake at once.

Dan's eyes snap open. Not Jeremiah sits up quickly. Kelly gasps and pulls the blanket down. Meremiah, startled, nearly falls off his couch.

**DAN**
(groggy)
What—

**MR. HOLT**
(cutting him off)
Don't move. Watch this.

He stands in front of the TV, blocking part of the screen. The news comes back from commercial.

**NEWS ANCHOR**
(on TV)
We're back with breaking news regarding NCTEJ=7/. For those just tuning in, authorities have confirmed that the escape plan leaked earlier this week is absolutely legitimate. This is not, and I repeat, not a hoax or AI-generated content.

Mr. Holt turns around to face them, his expression stern.

**MR. HOLT**
(pointing at the TV)
If any of you thought that was AI, you need to stop thinking that right now. You need to stop dismissing things just because they sound unbelievable.

Dan and Meremiah exchange looks. They're suddenly very awake.

**MEREMIAH**
(sitting up fully)
How do you know this is real?

**MR. HOLT**
Because I know the world. And I know when something is genuine threat versus noise. This is a threat.

Dan reaches for his tea cup on the coffee table. His hand trembles slightly as he brings it to his lips. He takes a long sip, processing what Mr. Holt is saying.

Meremiah does the same, reaching for his own cup and drinking deeply.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
What exactly is happening? What did she do?

**MR. HOLT**
(sitting down heavily)
Just listen.

## INT. NEW HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The TV continues with the news report.

**NEWS ANCHOR**
(on TV)
According to our sources, NCTEJ=7/ has been in solitary confinement for the past ~~three years~~eighteen months. During that time, she has meticulously planned her escape. We've obtained documents showing her methods, her timeline, and most disturbingly, her network of accomplices on the outside.

An IMAGE appears on the screen—a document with handwriting on it. The camera zooms in enough to show it's detailed, organized, methodical.

**NEWS ANCHOR** (CONT'D)
(on TV)
What makes this case unique is her ability to coordinate with people outside the prison walls despite being completely isolated. Investigators believe she's been using a contraband phone—a phone that somehow made it into her cell. We don't yet know how.

Dan and Meremiah stare at the TV. Kelly leans forward, invested now.

**NEWS ANCHOR** (CONT'D)
(on TV)
In a stunning development, we've also learned that NCTEJ=7/ has been documenting her entire escape plan on this phone. Text files, notes, diagrams—all of it stored in encrypted files that she's prepared to distribute once she's outside the prison.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(to Mr. Holt)
Why are you showing us this? What does this have to do with us?

**MR. HOLT**
(quietly)
Because the world is bigger and more dangerous than you think. And people like Jayride and Jayson—they're just the surface. There are bigger players doing bigger things.

The TV continues playing as they all sit in silence, watching.

## INT. NEW HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

The news report has concluded. Dan and the others sit in the aftermath, absorbing what they've learned.

**DAN**
(to Mr. Holt)
So she's really going to escape?

**MR. HOLT**
She's going to try. Whether she succeeds depends on many factors.

**KELLY**
(confused)
But why tell us? Why does it matter to us?

**MR. HOLT**
(standing up)
Because everything matters. Every action, every choice, every violation—it all matters. What happened in the attic of a residence last night is small in the grand scheme of things, but it's part of the same disease. People crossing lines. People breaking trust.

He leaves them with that thought and exits the living room.

Dan, Not Jeremiah, Kelly, and Meremiah sit there, trying to process everything.

## EXT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - DAY

The scene cuts to a completely different place. An outdoor area near what appears to be an old industrial building. It's weathered, forgotten, the kind of place people avoid.

NCTEJ=7/ (a woman with intense eyes, a weathered face, clearly someone who has survived things most people couldn't imagine) stands with a group of FORMER PRISONERS. They're all dressed casually, trying to blend in, but there's something dangerous about their presence.

They're talking quietly among themselves, laughing occasionally—a dark kind of laughter.

NCTEJ=7/ pulls out a phone. It's old, beaten up, clearly contraband. She looks at it for a moment, then dials a number.

The phone rings.

---

## INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - FELONIOUS CHARGES' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

FELONIOUS CHARGES (a woman with a sharp mind and sharper instincts, sitting behind a desk in what looks like a makeshift office) is working when her phone buzzes.

She sees the number and her expression doesn't change, but her body tenses slightly.

She answers.

**FELONIOUS CHARGES**
(into phone, carefully)
Hello?

---

## EXT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - CONTINUOUS

NCTEJ=7/ (voice only now) speaks into the phone. Her voice is calm, collected, dangerous.

**NCTEJ=7/**
(into phone)
It's me. I'm using a secure line. We need to talk about the release note.

**FELONIOUS CHARGES** (V.O.)
(into phone)
I told you not to call unless it was emergency.

**NCTEJ=7/**
(into phone)
This is an emergency. The plan moves faster now. I need you to distribute the petition. The back pages. Tell them it's a signature drive for prisoner rights reform. They won't look twice.

**FELONIOUS CHARGES** (V.O.)
(into phone, worried)
That's too risky. If they trace it—

**NCTEJ=7/**
(into phone, cutting her off)
They won't. Trust me. I've been planning this for eighteen months. Every detail, every contingency. This works or I die in that cell. And I have no intention of dying.

She hangs up.

NCTEJ=7/ puts the phone away and turns back to the group of FORMER PRISONERS. She smiles—a cold, calculated smile.

**NCTEJ=7/**
(to the group)
We're almost ready.

---

## INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - FELONIOUS CHARGES' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Felonious Charges hangs up and sits back in her chair. She's thinking. Planning. Her mind is already working through the logistics.

She pulls out a folder from a drawer—inside are dozens of petition papers. On the back of each one, hidden in plain sight, are coded messages and instructions.

She starts making phone calls.

---

## EXT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - CONTINUOUS

Back at the industrial location, NCTEJ=7/ watches as the SUN begins to set. The sky turns orange and red.

She looks at her phone again, then out at the city skyline in the distance.

**NCTEJ=7/**
(to herself)
Soon.

The camera pulls back slowly, showing NCTEJ=7/ and the group of FORMER PRISONERS standing together as the sun sets behind them. They're silhouettes now, dark shapes against a burning sky.

The music swells—dark, ominous, inevitable.
