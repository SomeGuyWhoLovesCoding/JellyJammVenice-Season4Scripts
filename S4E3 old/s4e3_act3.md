## INT. NEW HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

Jayride walks back upstairs from the kitchen, his plate empty. He's heading toward his room when Not Jeremiah appears from one of the other rooms.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Hey. I need to talk to you about something.

Jayride stops. He looks cautious.

**JAYRIDE**
What's up?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Yesterday. Dan mentioned he saw you doing something near his wall. Near the attic.

Jayride's face goes pale. He knows exactly what Not Jeremiah is talking about.

**JAYRIDE**
I wasn't—

**NOT JEREMIAH**
He said you were playing with yourself. In front of his wall.

Jayride doesn't say anything. He just looks down at his feet.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
Did you touch it? Did you touch the wall?

**JAYRIDE**
No. No, I didn't touch it. I swear. I was just... I was just standing there. I didn't do anything to it.

Not Jeremiah studies him for a moment, trying to figure out if he's lying. Jayride meets his eyes, and something in his expression suggests he's telling the truth.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
You're on restriction for one day. Don't go near the attic. Don't go near that wall. Understand?

**JAYRIDE**
Yeah. Yeah, I understand.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Get out of my sight.

Jayride nods and quickly heads to his room, closing the door behind him.

Not Jeremiah watches him go, then heads back downstairs.

## INT. NEW HOUSE - JAYRIDE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jayride sits on his bed, staring at nothing. He's clearly bothered by what just happened. His expression shifts from worry to something darker—something more determined.

He stands up and walks to his window, looking out at the neighborhood beyond.

**JAYRIDE**
(to himself)
One day. I can wait one day.

He turns back to face his room. His eyes are harder now. More focused.

**JAYRIDE** (CONT'D)
I'm going to ruin that wall. Tonight. When everyone's asleep.

He nods to himself, as if he's made a decision he can't take back. He sits back on his bed and waits.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Hours have passed. The house is quieter now. It's evening, and most of the family has retreated to their rooms.

Jayride comes downstairs carefully, moving like he's trying not to make any noise. He checks the security cameras—they're off. He checks the TV—it's off. He checks the fridge—it's closed.

But then he hesitates. He's bored. Anxious. He needs something to do while he waits for midnight.

He opens the fridge.

He stares inside for a moment, then pulls out a whole block of cheese snack. He holds it in his hand, looking at it.

**JAYRIDE**
(to himself)
This will do.

He closes the fridge and sits on the couch, eating the cheese block slowly. But even as he eats, he doesn't feel satisfied. He feels bored. Restless.

He finishes the cheese block and sits back, staring at the wall.

**JAYRIDE** (CONT'D)
(to himself)
Okay. It's almost time. Let's do this.

He stands up, takes a breath, and heads toward the staircase. He moves quietly, deliberately, with purpose.

The camera follows him as he climbs the stairs.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Jayride reaches the top of the stairs and pauses. He listens for any sounds coming from the other rooms. All he hears is silence and the occasional creak of the house settling.

He moves toward the attic stairs.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Jayride climbs the stairs slowly, carefully, making sure each step is silent.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC - NIGHT

Jayride emerges into the attic. It's dark up here. The only light comes from the moon filtering through the glass ceiling above.

He can make out the shape of his favorite wall in the darkness. He stands there for a moment, just looking at it.

Then he hears something.

A sound from behind him. A movement.

He spins around.

MEREMIAH is standing at the top of the attic stairs, eyes barely open, looking half-asleep. One eye is more open than the other, like he's only half-awake.

**MEREMIAH**
What are you doing up here?

**JAYRIDE**
I... I was just...

**MEREMIAH**
You're supposed to be on restriction. You're not supposed to be up here.

**JAYRIDE**
I know, I just—

**MEREMIAH**
Get out. Now. I'm guarding this wall. Dan doesn't trust you near it, and I'm making sure you don't get anywhere close.

Meremiah moves toward Jayride, his movements slow but deliberate. He starts to nudge him toward the stairs.

But then—

JAYSON appears at the top of the attic stairs, having climbed them silently.

**JAYSON**
Hey. I'm coming up too.

Meremiah, already tired, turns to face Jayson.

**MEREMIAH**
No you're not. Go back downstairs.

**JAYSON**
Come on, man. I just want to see the wall.

**MEREMIAH**
Absolutely not.

Meremiah moves toward Jayson to physically remove him from the attic, but as he does, JAYSON pulls out a small packet from his pocket. It's melatonin powder. He opens it and releases it into the air.

The powder spreads through the attic, floating like dust in the moonlight.

**JAYSON**
This will make everyone have a healthier sleep schedule.

He laughs at his own joke—a harsh, almost maniacal laugh.

Meremiah starts to protest, but his eyes are already getting heavy. The melatonin is working faster than it should. He tries to take a step toward Jayson but his legs won't cooperate.

**MEREMIAH**
What did you... what are you...

His words trail off. He staggers backward and collapses onto a pile of boxes, his eyes closing. He's asleep almost instantly, his body going completely limp.

Jayson watches him fall with a grin on his face.

**JAYSON**
(to himself)
Perfect.

He pulls out a flashlight and shines it at Jayride, telling him without words to go ahead. This is their moment.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

Jayride wastes no time. He heads straight for the favorite wall. Jayson follows him, shining the flashlight to illuminate the wall in the darkness.

Jayride starts doing things to the wall. Nasty things. Things that Dan would never want anyone to do to his favorite wall.

The camera doesn't show the details, but it's clear from the sounds and movements that something is happening.

Jayson watches, shining his flashlight, occasionally laughing.

They're lost in what they're doing. They don't notice time passing.

---

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC - FOUR HOURS LATER

The moon has moved across the sky. The light through the glass ceiling is different now—it's the light of early morning.

Meremiah suddenly stirs. His eyes open. He looks confused, like he's waking from a dream he can't quite remember.

He sits up slowly, looking around.

**MEREMIAH**
(to himself)
What happened? Why am I...

He hears noises coming from deeper in the attic. Noises that shouldn't be there at this hour.

He stands up, still groggy, and walks toward the sounds.

He reaches the spot where the favorite wall is and stops cold.

He sees what Jayride and Jayson have done to the wall.

**MEREMIAH**
(in shock)
What the—

But before he can finish, Jayride—who heard his footsteps—grabs a can of ant spray from somewhere in the attic and sprays it directly at Meremiah's face.

Meremiah screams and staggers backward, his hands covering his face.

The sound echoes through the house.

It's loud. Loud enough to wake people downstairs.
