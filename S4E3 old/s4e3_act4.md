## INT. NEW HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Dan, Not Jeremiah, and Kelly have woken up from the sound of screaming. They're all confused, looking around the living room trying to figure out what's happening.

**DAN**
What was that noise?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Came from upstairs.

**KELLY**
Maybe it was Meremiah?

They all exchange nervous looks. Something doesn't feel right.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Come on. Let's go check it out.

But before they can move, Not Jeremiah stops.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
Actually, let's check down here first. See if anything's wrong.

Dan nods and they move through the living room, checking things. Dan spots the fridge and opens it.

**DAN**
The cheese snack is gone. Someone ate it.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Who would eat the whole block?

**KELLY**
Wait. There's something on the counter.

They walk over to the kitchen counter. There's a block of cheese sitting there, clearly old. The date on it reads 2026.

**KELLY** (CONT'D)
This cheese is from 2026. That's... that's really old.

Without thinking, Kelly picks up the moldy cheese and starts eating it.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Kelly, stop. That's disgusting.

**KELLY**
(mouth full)
It's fine. It tastes okay.

**DAN**
You're going to get sick.

**KELLY**
Probably, but we need to figure out what happened. This could be a clue.

Meremiah comes downstairs, looking disheveled and confused. His eyes are red and watery. He looks like he's been crying.

**MEREMIAH**
What's going on? Why is everyone up?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
What happened to you? Your eyes—

**MEREMIAH**
I got sprayed. With something. Ant spray, I think. I was upstairs and—

**DAN**
Sprayed? Why would someone spray you?

**MEREMIAH**
Because I caught them doing something. Something bad. Upstairs. In the attic.

Not Jeremiah and Dan look at each other. Their expressions shift to serious.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
We need to go up there.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
But first, let me check downstairs to make sure nothing else is wrong.

He moves through the house, checking things. Then he stops.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
All the drawers are open. Why are all the drawers open?

**DAN**
(frustrated)
I don't know! But we need to get upstairs!

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Okay, okay. Let's go.

They head upstairs with Meremiah following behind.

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

They reach the attic and stop in their tracks.

Dan sees his favorite wall.

He doesn't move. He doesn't speak. He just stares at it. At what's been done to it.

The smell hits them all at once—a sickening, unmistakable smell that makes Kelly gag.

**DAN**
(quietly)
No. No, no, no.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Oh god.

Dan walks toward the wall slowly, like he's in a trance. He stops in front of it, looking at the damage, at what Jayride and Jayson have done.

Dan's face crumples. His eyes fill with tears. He starts crying—not quietly, but openly, his whole body shaking.

**DAN**
(sobbing)
Why? Why would they do this?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
(looking around)
Where are they? Where are Jayride and Jayson?

Jayride and Jayson are standing in the shadows of the attic, trying to stay hidden. But Not Jeremiah spots them.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
You two. You did this.

They don't answer. They just stand there, looking at the ground.

**DAN**
(still crying)
This was my wall. This was the only thing I had.

Not Jeremiah walks over to Dan and puts his hand on his shoulder.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Hey. Hey, look at me. Look at me.

Dan looks up at him, tears streaming down his face.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
Your obsession with this wall doesn't define you. You know that, right?

**DAN**
But they ruined it. They just... they just ruined it.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
I know. But we can fix it. We're going to make them clean it up. And then it's going to be okay.

Dan wipes his eyes and nods, though he doesn't look convinced.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
(to Jayride and Jayson)
You two. You're going to clean this up. Every inch of it. And while you do, we're going to draw a line here. A square around this wall. And if you ever erase that line, if you ever touch it, you're going to be punished twice as long. Do you understand?

**JAYRIDE**
(quietly)
Yeah. We understand.

**JAYSON**
(quietly)
We're sorry.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
I don't want to hear it. Just clean it up.

Dan walks over to the wall and points to where he wants the square drawn. Not Jeremiah takes a marker and carefully draws a square around the wall, marking its boundaries.

**NOT JEREMIAH** (CONT'D)
This is it. This is the line. You don't cross it.

Jayride and Jayson nod and start cleaning up the mess they made.

## INT. NEW HOUSE - ATTIC - LATER

Jayride and Jayson are scrubbing the wall down, trying to clean it as best they can. Dan watches them intensely, making sure they don't miss a spot.

Water spills and accidentally washes over the line that was drawn, but Dan nods.

**DAN**
That's okay. As long as you don't erase the corners.

They keep cleaning.

Suddenly, a loud CRASH from outside. A window opens.

MR. HOLT (50s, weathered face, serious expression) climbs through the attic window with a crowbar. He looks shocked, taking in the scene—Jayride and Jayson cleaning, Dan watching, the wall still smelling wrong.

**MR. HOLT**
What in god's name happened here?

**DAN**
(explaining quickly)
They... they did stuff to my wall. Bad stuff. We made them clean it up.

Mr. Holt surveys the scene, then looks at Jayride and Jayson with a mixture of disappointment and anger.

**MR. HOLT**
(to Jayride and Jayson)
You two are restricted from the attic. Indefinitely.

He reaches out and takes their phone from Jayride's pocket.

**MR. HOLT** (CONT'D)
Let me see what you've been doing.

He scrolls through it, checking the search history. Nothing comes up.

**MR. HOLT** (CONT'D)
You were in incognito mode.

**JAYRIDE**
(nervously)
Yeah, we were, but we turned it off before—

Mr. Holt opens the browser. His face goes pale as he sees what pops up. There are 83 open tabs—all pornographic sites, all extremely explicit content.

He keeps scrolling. 202 inactive tabs. More of the same.

**MR. HOLT**
(in shock)
Eighty-three tabs? Two hundred and two?

**JAYSON**
(quickly)
Those ad pop-ups kept opening. Every site we went to had the same ad. And when we clicked on one, it just opened more tabs. We couldn't stop them. That's how we lost track of how many we had.

Mr. Holt stares at the phone, his hands shaking. His eyes fill with tears. He sits down slowly on a nearby box, overwhelmed.

**MR. HOLT**
(quietly)
What are you two doing to yourselves?

Meremiah appears in the attic doorway, looking at the whips still lying on the ground.

**MEREMIAH**
(to Jayride and Jayson)
You two need to leave.

**JAYRIDE**
We're trying to clean—

**MEREMIAH**
I said leave.

**JAYRIDE**
But one of us had ant spray. I'm the one who did it.

For a moment, Dan looks like he's about to say something harsh. But then his expression softens. He realizes Meremiah had hurt. He starts feeling sorry for him.

**DAN**
(to Not Jeremiah)
He got hurt.

**NOT JEREMIAH**
Yeah. He did.

Dan and Not Jeremiah both start crying—not sobbing, but quiet tears running down their faces.

Kelly knocks on the attic door from the hallway.

**KELLY** (O.S.)
Hey, can I come in?

**NOT JEREMIAH**
No. The attic is in maintenance right now.

**KELLY** (O.S.)
Okay.

They hear her footsteps heading downstairs.

**MEREMIAH**
YOU FUCKING WHAT!?
