### ACT THREE - Next Day In (October 2018)

---

## INT. HARRISON HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

*The hallway is chaotic. Students move through it with a different energy than six months ago. There's a restlessness, an anger in the air.*

*MS. RANDOM walks down the hallway, and students part for her like she's a celebrity. Some follow her, hanging on her every word.*

*She passes the PRINCIPAL (58), who looks haggard and defeated. He avoids her gaze.*

**MS. RANDOM**
*(to her followers)*
They want you to believe their lies. But you're smarter than that now.

*The students nod in agreement, their faces showing the early stages of indoctrination.*

---

## INT. HARRISON HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

*MS. RANDOM stands before her class. The room is now packed with 50+ students—far exceeding capacity. They sit on desks, lean against walls, stand in the back.*

**MS. RANDOM**
By now, you should have questioned every authority figure in your life. Your parents. Your teachers. Your government. What have you learned?

*A STUDENT (17) raises his hand eagerly.*

**STUDENT 1**
That they're all lying to us.

**MS. RANDOM**
Correct. And what do we do about lies?

*The class responds in unison, like a cult chant.*

**CLASS**
We expose them. We tear them down. We build something new.

*MS. RANDOM smiles coldly. The indoctrination is working perfectly.*

---

## INT. HARRISON HIGH SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - LATER

*The PRINCIPAL sits across from the SUPERINTENDENT (62, administrative, tired).*

**SUPERINTENDENT**
We have reports of teacher harassment. Students refusing to do assignments. A complete breakdown of classroom discipline.

**PRINCIPAL**
It's Ms. Random. She's corrupted them. She's turned this school into—

**SUPERINTENDENT**
Into what? A place where students question authority? That's bad?

**PRINCIPAL**
It's chaos. She's not teaching. She's indoctrinating.

**SUPERINTENDENT**
Do you have evidence?

**PRINCIPAL**
Look at the attendance records. Look at the grades. Look at the testimonies from other teachers.

*The superintendent sits back, considering.*

**SUPERINTENDENT**
I'll look into it. But be careful with accusations. We live in a different world now. People appreciate educators who inspire critical thinking.

*The principal realizes the battle is lost. The system itself has been compromised.*

---

## INT. HARRISON COLLEGE - STUDENT CENTER - DAY

*The college feels different. The atmosphere is tense, fractured.*

*NCTEJ=7/ and FELONIOUS stand near a bulletin board, observing students forming groups—cliques based on ideology rather than friendship.*

*FELONIOUS points to different groups.*

**FELONIOUS**
We've successfully divided the student body into seven distinct factions. Each one distrusts the others.

**NCTEJ=7/**
How many professors have resigned?

**FELONIOUS**
Twelve. Another eight are under investigation by our student review board.

**NCTEJ=7/**
Good. We need to replace them with people who understand the mission.

*They walk past the COLLEGE PRESIDENT (68, looking increasingly frail and confused). He watches them go, aware that control of his institution has slipped from his hands.*

---

## INT. HARRISON COLLEGE - MATHEMATICS CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

*NCTEJ=7/ stands before a classroom of 80+ students. The original professor is nowhere to be seen.*

**NCTEJ=7/**
Mathematics isn't a neutral language. It's a tool of Western imperialism used to quantify and control nature. To truly think freely, you must question mathematical paradigms.

*A STUDENT (19) looks troubled.*

**STUDENT 2**
But... don't we need math to build things? To understand physics?

**NCTEJ=7/**
*(dismissively)*
That's colonial thinking. Indigenous cultures thrived without Euclidean geometry.

*The student sits back, confused but unable to articulate why this argument feels wrong.*

*NCTEJ smiles. The corruption of education is accelerating perfectly.*

---

## INT. HEALING MINDS THERAPY CENTER - RECEPTION AREA - DAY

*The waiting room is now packed with clients. It's standing room only. The walls are decorated with soothing colors, but the energy feels toxic.*

*VICTORIA walks through, greeting clients with false warmth.*

**VICTORIA**
Hello, Margaret. How are you feeling?

**CLIENT 1** *(Margaret, 45)*
I... I can't make a decision without calling you first. I'm worried I'm getting worse.

**VICTORIA**
That's not worse. That's dependence. And dependence means you're healing. You're learning to trust.

*Margaret nods, accepting this toxic logic.*

*VICTORIA moves to another client.*

**VICTORIA**
*(to Client 2, Tony, 32)*
I'm increasing your medication again. We need to stabilize your neurochemistry.

**CLIENT 2** *(Tony)*
But I've gained forty pounds since I started seeing you. And I'm more anxious than before.

**VICTORIA**
That's the medication working. These are signs of progress. Trust the process.

*Tony reluctantly accepts another prescription.*

*In the back office, VICTORIA reviews her client files. She makes notes: "Client dependency: 87%", "Medication compliance: 94%", "Return rate: 100%".*

*She's running a psychological drug cartel.*

---

## INT. INDUSTRIAL WAREHOUSE - LABORATORY SPACE - NIGHT

*YANNARIS's operation has expanded dramatically. The warehouse now has multiple lab stations, manufacturing equipment, and boxes of supplies.*

*YANNARIS (now thinner, more obsessive) works alongside three ASSISTANTS—all young, all hungry for the work.*

**YANNARIS**
The first batches are ready for distribution testing. Small quantities to selected high school students.

**ASSISTANT 1**
How many?

**YANNARIS**
Start with fifty. Monitor their responses. Document everything. We need to understand which compounds work best with different neurotypes.

*He holds up a small vial of blue powder.*

**YANNARIS** *(continuing)*
This one is for teenagers. It mimics ADHD medication but with an addictive component. Once they try it, they'll come back.

**ASSISTANT 2**
Isn't that unethical?

**YANNARIS**
*(laughing)*
Ethics are for people who aren't building the future.

*He hands the vials to the assistants.*

**YANNARIS** *(continuing)*
The College Bus frame is being fabricated. Delivery in six months. By then, we'll know which compounds work. We'll be ready for mass distribution.

---

## INT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT - INVESTMENT FIRM - DAY

*JAMES (25 now, looking older, more cynical) sits in a conference room with MARCUS and four HEDGE FUND MANAGERS (all wealthy, all morally compromised).*

**JAMES**
We've begun positioning. Short positions in housing. Long positions in defensive stocks. By 2024, we want market instability. By 2027, we want panic. By 2029, we want collapse.

**HEDGE FUND MANAGER 1** *(Reid, 55)*
How much profit are we talking?

**JAMES**
If you're positioned correctly, you could be worth ten billion dollars by 2029. Everyone else will be worth nothing.

*The hedge fund managers nod, their greed overriding any moral hesitation.*

**MARCUS**
You'll be the wealthiest men in the world. And you'll never have to explain how it happened.

**HEDGE FUND MANAGER 2** *(Chen, 48)*
I'm in. But I need assurance this plan is airtight.

**JAMES**
It is. We've been planning for eleven years. Every variable has been calculated. Every contingency has been prepared for.

*He pulls up a chart showing the projected economic decline from 2018 to 2029. The line goes down, down, down—a perfect precipice toward financial annihilation.*

---

## INT. SPRUNKIS' RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

*The Sprunkis are together, watching the news. It's April 2019. Things are starting to feel off to them.*

**NEWS ANCHOR** *(on screen)*
...reports of increased student activism across the nation. Teachers report a growing disconnect from traditional curriculum. College enrollment continues to decline. Therapy center admissions are up 300%...

*BRANDON mutes the television.*

**BRANDON**
Something's happening. I don't know what it is, but something's wrong.

**SIMON**
What do you mean?

**BRANDON**
My sister goes to Harrison High. She told me Ms. Random is... I don't know, like a cult leader. She's got hundreds of students hanging on every word.

**CHARLOTTE**
That's just one teacher.

**BRANDON**
Is it? My mom went to that therapy center—Healing Minds. She says her therapist has her on six medications now and she's worse than before. My friend's parents sent him to college and now he says his professors are trying to destroy him intellectually.

*OWAKCX leans forward.*

**OWAKCX**
You're saying these aren't isolated incidents?

**BRANDON**
I'm saying they feel connected. I'm saying if I didn't know better, I'd think someone was deliberately trying to destabilize everything.

*The room falls silent. What BRANDON is suggesting seems paranoid, but it's also starting to make sense.*

**SKY**
That's crazy.

**BRANDON**
Is it? Or is it just what crazy looks like when it's happening?

*They sit in uncomfortable silence as the muted television flickers behind them.*

---

## INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - NIGHT

*Multiple screens line the walls, showing feeds from various locations: Harrison High, Harrison College, Healing Minds Therapy Center, the drug lab, financial firm offices.*

*VERA (58) and OSCAR (55) monitor the feeds.*

**VERA**
The Sprunkis are becoming suspicious.

**OSCAR**
Should we accelerate their capture?

**VERA**
No. Not yet. Let them think. Let them investigate. The more they dig, the more entangled they become. When we finally take them, they'll be desperate. And desperate people are useful.

*She points to one of the screens showing Brandon in the Sprunkis' living room.*

**VERA** *(continuing)*
This one—Brandon. He's the leader. If we get him, the others will fall in line.

**OSCAR**
Should I inform David?

**VERA**
Not yet. We monitor. We wait. We prepare.

*She leans back, satisfied with the long game.*

---

## INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

*The full Zorch Group meets for their quarterly status report. Six months in, the plan is accelerating perfectly.*

**DAVID**
Report.

*MARCUS stands first.*

**MARCUS**
Ms. Random has successfully indoctrinated the high school. Student body is divided into factions. Authority has been undermined. The principal is powerless.

*THOMAS stands.*

**THOMAS**
Nctej and Felonious have fractured the college. Twelve professors have resigned. The remaining faculty are either corrupted or intimidated. The college will collapse from within within three years.

*NINA stands.*

**NINA**
Victoria has created a dependency network of 400+ therapy clients. Each one is on multiple medications. Each one returns weekly. Her operation is self-sustaining.

*LEO stands.*

**LEO**
Yannaris has completed prototype drug compounds. Initial testing begins next month in selected high schools. By 2024, distribution will be widespread. The College Bus will be operational by 2020.

*JAMES stands.*

**JAMES**
Economic manipulation is ahead of schedule. We've established relationships with major financial players. Market destabilization will begin in 2021. Full collapse by 2029 is assured.

*DAVID stands, commanding the room's full attention.*

**DAVID**
Six months. We are exactly on schedule. In fact, we are ahead. The world has no idea what's happening. By the time they realize, it will be far too late.

*He walks to a large map on the wall—showing Harrison, the surrounding area, radiating outward.*

**DAVID** *(continuing)*
Phase one is complete. We have established control of education, therapy, pharmaceuticals, and finance in this region. Phase two begins immediately. We expand. We spread. We replicate this model in every major city.

*He points to VERA.*

**DAVID**
Vera, what of the Sprunkis?

**VERA**
They're beginning to see the patterns. They're beginning to suspect. Soon, they'll try to stop us.

**DAVID**
When they do, we will be ready. They will become the perfect example. Trapped, desperate, and ultimately serving our purpose.

*He returns to his seat.*

**DAVID** *(continuing)*
Eight and a half years remain until 2029. The pieces are in place. The dominoes have been arranged. Now we push them.

*He raises a glass. The entire room follows.*

**DAVID**
To the collapse.

*The Zorch Group echoes in unison:*

**ALL**
To the collapse.

*They drink. The camera pulls back, showing the 18 members in their underground chamber, fully committed to their vision of destruction.*
