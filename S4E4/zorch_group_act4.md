# THE ZORCH GROUP
## Season 4, Episode 4 - Act Four

### ACT FOUR - The Trap Closes (September 2018 - Present Day)

*This act serves as both a continuation of the present timeline and a bridging point to the future. It shows the moment the Sprunkis decide to act, and the moment The Zorch Group moves against them.*

---

## INT. SPRUNKIS' RESIDENCE - BRANDON'S ROOM - NIGHT

*It's now September 2018—18 months after The Zorch Group's commitment in October 2018. But we're experiencing it in real-time now, in the "present day" of the episode.*

*BRANDON sits at his computer, researching. Open tabs show: news articles about declining college enrollment, teacher resignations, therapy center controversies, economic forecasts.*

*His walls are now covered with printed articles, connected by red string—the classic conspiracy theorist setup. But he's not paranoid. He's just connecting real dots.*

*SIMON enters through the open door.*

**SIMON**
You're still doing this?

**BRANDON**
Look at this. Six months ago, my sister said her high school teacher was weird. Now there are articles in three newspapers about Ms. Random. The same teacher. And look—

*He points to another article.*

**BRANDON** *(continuing)*
—the therapy center where my mom went just went through a lawsuit. Clients claiming they became more dependent on medications, not less.

**SIMON**
So what? Isolated incidents.

**BRANDON**
Isolated? There's a college professor who went on the news saying the curriculum is being deliberately corrupted. A hedge fund manager is under investigation for market manipulation. A pharmaceutical lab was raided.

*SIMON sits down, genuinely concerned now.*

**SIMON**
What are you saying?

**BRANDON**
I'm saying someone is doing this on purpose. I'm saying there's an organization, or a group, or something, deliberately destabilizing everything.

**SIMON**
That's... that's a massive conspiracy theory.

**BRANDON**
Is it? Or is it just the truth that sounds crazy because it IS crazy?

*SIMON doesn't have an answer.*

---

## INT. SPRUNKIS' RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

*The entire group of Sprunkis is gathered. BRANDON has called them all together.*

*He stands before them with his evidence wall visible behind him.*

**BRANDON**
I know this sounds insane. But I need you to listen. Something is happening. Something organized. And I think we need to do something about it.

**CHARLOTTE**
Like what?

**BRANDON**
Like investigate. Like find out who's behind this. Like warn people.

**RADDY**
Brandon, you're talking about a massive conspiracy. That requires resources, organization, power. Who has that kind of capability?

**BRANDON**
I don't know. Yet. But I'm going to find out.

*OWAKCX stands up.*

**OWAKCX**
Then we help you. Whatever this is, we figure it out together.

*One by one, the other Sprunkis nod in agreement. They're committing to something they don't fully understand.*

**SKY**
Where do we even start?

**BRANDON**
Ms. Random. She's at the center of the high school corruption. If we can figure out how she got there, who put her there, maybe we can trace it back to whoever's behind all of this.

**JORDAN**
And if we're wrong? If this is just coincidence and we've been paranoid for nothing?

**BRANDON**
Then we've wasted some time investigating. But if we're right...

*He doesn't need to finish the sentence. They all understand.*

---

## INT. HARRISON HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

*The Sprunkis—now acting as amateur investigators—enter the school. BRANDON and CHARLOTTE go to the administration office. SIMON and SKY observe Ms. Random's classroom from a distance. The others split up to gather information.*

*BRANDON approaches the SECRETARY (52).*

**BRANDON**
Hi, I'm working on a school project about teacher hiring practices. Can I see the personnel file for Ms. Random?

**SECRETARY**
That's private information.

**BRANDON**
Is it public record?

*The secretary hesitates.*

**SECRETARY**
I'll have to check with the principal.

*CHARLOTTE notices something on the secretary's desk—an inter-office memo from The Zorch Group, partially visible. It reads: "Continue supporting Ms. Random. Full operational oversight..."*

*Before she can take a photo, the memo is noticed and quickly hidden.*

*The secretary stands up, suspicious.*

**SECRETARY**
Why do you need this information?

**BRANDON**
I told you. School project.

**SECRETARY**
I don't think so. You need to leave.

*The secretary picks up the phone. BRANDON and CHARLOTTE exchange a look—they've seen something they weren't supposed to.*

---

## INT. SURVEILLANCE ROOM - UNDERGROUND FACILITY - CONTINUOUS

*VERA and OSCAR watch the security camera feeds from Harrison High School. They see BRANDON and CHARLOTTE leaving the office.*

**VERA**
They're investigating.

**OSCAR**
Should we stop them?

**VERA**
No. Not yet. Let them dig. Let them get closer. The more committed they become, the more trapped they'll be when we finally move.

*She makes a note in a file labeled "SPRUNKIS - INVESTIGATION PHASE".*

---

## INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

*The Sprunkis gather in a booth. BRANDON shows the others what they've learned so far.*

**BRANDON**
That memo was real. I saw it. It said something about "operational oversight" and "continuing support" for Ms. Random. That's not normal administrative language.

**VINERIA**
Did you get a photo?

**BRANDON**
No. They saw me. But I got enough. Someone is actively supporting Ms. Random's curriculum. Someone above the school.

**BRUD**
What about the therapy center? What did you find?

**RADDY**
Four lawsuits filed in the past year. All clients claiming psychological dependency. All clients on multiple medications. One person claimed the therapist deliberately increased her medication doses to keep her coming back.

**TUNNER**
And the college?

**JORDAN**
Two professors have hired lawyers. They're claiming they were forced out for not conforming to a specific educational ideology. One of them is talking to journalists.

*BRANDON leans back, the picture becoming clearer.*

**BRANDON**
It's coordinated. It's not random. Someone is running an operation across multiple institutions.

**SKY**
But who? And why?

*Before anyone can answer, BRANDON's phone buzzes. An unknown number. He answers.*

**VOICE** *(through phone, electronic distortion)*
Stop investigating.

*The line goes dead.*

*The Sprunkis freeze. The threat was unmistakable.*

**CHARLOTTE**
That was them. Whoever they are, they know we're investigating.

**BRANDON**
Then we need to move faster.

---

## INT. HARRISON HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

*The Sprunkis have snuck into the school after hours. They're in Ms. Random's office, searching through files.*

*SIMON finds a locked drawer. OWAKCX picks the lock.*

*Inside: correspondence. Letters from a person named "DAVID" with instructions on curriculum design. Payment records. A membership roster for something called "THE ZORCH GROUP."*

**SIMON**
This is it. This is the proof.

*Suddenly, alarms sound. Red lights flash throughout the gymnasium.*

*A voice comes through the intercom.*

**VOICE** *(over intercom)*
You are trespassing on a secure facility. Exit immediately or you will be apprehended.

*The Sprunkis run. They make it out of the building, but as they exit, they see ARMED FIGURES in tactical gear surrounding the parking lot.*

**BRANDON**
Run!

*They scatter. Some make it to the parking lot. Others run into the woods.*

*Gunfire sounds—not lethal, but close. Tear gas canisters are deployed.*

*The chase is on.*

---

## EXT. FOREST NEAR HARRISON HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT

*BRANDON runs through the woods with SIMON, CHARLOTTE, and SKY. Behind them, ARMED FIGURES pursue.*

**BRANDON**
*(shouting)*
Keep moving! Stay together!

*They burst through the trees and find themselves on a highway. A black van screeches to a halt in front of them.*

*The doors open. ARMED FIGURES emerge.*

*There's nowhere left to run.*

**BRANDON** *(to the others)*
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I got you into this.

*The armed figures surround them, weapons drawn (but not pointed, yet).*

**ARMED FIGURE 1**
You have the right to remain silent.

**SIMON**
Who are you? What is this?

**ARMED FIGURE 2**
You've been investigating The Zorch Group. You've been terminated from that investigation as of now.

*They force the Sprunkis into the van.*

---

## INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - HOLDING AREA - NIGHT

*BRANDON, SIMON, CHARLOTTE, and SKY are placed in a cell. Concrete walls. Steel door. A single light hanging from the ceiling.*

*They sit in shock, processing what just happened.*

**SKY**
What do they want from us?

**BRANDON**
I don't know. But we found something. We found proof of their organization. And they're not letting us go.

*The other six Sprunkis—OWAKCX, VINERIA, TUNNER, RADDY, JORDAN, and BRUD—are being brought to adjacent cells through a window.*

*A speaker crackles to life.*

**VOICE** *(over speaker)*
Welcome to the Zorch Group.

*It's DAVID's voice. Cold. Patient. Inevitable.*

**DAVID** *(continuing)*
You've been very curious. Very determined. And now you belong to us.

**BRANDON**
*(to the speaker)*
Let us go! We know what you're doing! We have evidence!

**DAVID**
The evidence you found is now secured. The files you accessed are destroyed. And you ten have become very useful assets.

*CHARLOTTE stands up.*

**CHARLOTTE**
We'll escape. We'll tell people.

**DAVID**
You'll try. You'll fail. And in failing, you'll understand that resistance against The Zorch Group is futile.

*A pause. The weight of their situation settles on them.*

**DAVID** *(continuing)*
You are now part of Phase Two. Your desperation, your anger, your despair—all of it will be channeled toward our purposes. You'll watch as your friends succumb to addiction, as your families fall apart, as your society collapses. And you'll have no choice but to witness it.

*The speaker cuts out.*

*The Sprunkis sit in complete silence. They've walked directly into the trap.*

---

## INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

*DAVID, VERA, and the other Zorch Group members watch the Sprunkis through a one-way window.*

**VERA**
They're trapped.

**DAVID**
Yes. And they'll be very useful. They're intelligent. Determined. Desperate. Those qualities will serve us well.

**MARCUS**
What do you want to do with them?

**DAVID**
For now, they watch. They wait. They despair. In a few months, when the next phases accelerate, we'll use them as examples. We'll show the world what happens to those who resist.

*He places his hand on the glass, looking at the Sprunkis in their cell.*

**DAVID** *(continuing)*
The game is moving into its final stages. By 2029, everything will fall. And they'll be here to see it all collapse.

---

## INT. SPRUNKIS' CELL - NIGHT

*BRANDON sits against the wall, head in his hands. The others lie on the concrete floor, trying to process.*

*SIMON sits next to BRANDON.*

**SIMON**
We should have left this alone.

**BRANDON**
Yeah. We should have.

*There's a moment of shared regret. But also, something else. The realization that what they discovered was real. That the conspiracy they uncovered is actually happening.*

*The camera pulls back, showing the cell from above. Ten young people, trapped, helpless, at the mercy of an organization they barely understand.*

*The lights slowly dim.*

---

## INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

*The full Zorch Group is gathered. DAVID stands at the head of the table.*

**DAVID**
The Sprunkis are secure. They represent a minor complication that has now become an asset. The timeline is perfect. In approximately nine and a half years, all phases will be complete. The world will collapse. And a new order will begin.

*He looks at each member, one by one.*

**DAVID** *(continuing)*
You have all served The Zorch Group faithfully. What happens next will reshape human civilization. When historians look back on this moment, they will call it the end of one era and the beginning of another.

*He raises his hand.*

**DAVID**
To 2029.

*The entire room responds:*

**ALL**
To 2029.

*The camera pulls back, showing the entire organization in their underground chamber. 18 architects of collapse. 18 people committed to screwing the whole world over, one institution at a time.*

*Slowly, the lights fade to black.*
