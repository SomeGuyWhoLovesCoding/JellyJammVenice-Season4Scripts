### ACT TWO - The Plan Unfolds (October 2018)

---

## INT. HARRISON HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

*The classroom is modern but sterile. Motivational posters hang on the walls, but they feel hollow. MS. RANDOM (41, cold professionalism masked as warmth) stands at the front of the room, addressing her students.*

*A slide on the screen reads: "Critical Thinking: Questioning Everything, Trusting Nothing"*

*The students—approximately 30 of them—sit in orderly rows, taking notes mechanically. No one raises their hand. No one questions.*

**MS. RANDOM**
Authority is an illusion designed to control you. Every institution—government, education, family—exists only to maintain power over your minds. Your job is to tear it all down.

*A STUDENT (16, tentatively) raises their hand.*

**STUDENT**
Ms. Random, but... what do we replace it with?

**MS. RANDOM**
*(smiling coldly)*
That's not your concern. Your job is destruction. Others will handle what comes next.

*She turns back to the board, writing in aggressive strokes.*

*The camera pans across the students' faces. They look confused, but compliant. This curriculum is brand new. This is the beginning.*

---

## INT. HARRISON HIGH SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - LATER

*MS. RANDOM sits across from the PRINCIPAL (58, traditional, concerned). The principal has a file open on his desk.*

**PRINCIPAL**
Ms. Random, I've had several parents call about your curriculum. They're concerned about the anti-authority messaging.

**MS. RANDOM**
With respect, sir, those parents are part of the problem. They're trying to preserve outdated power structures. These students need to learn critical thinking.

**PRINCIPAL**
This isn't critical thinking. This is indoctrination.

**MS. RANDOM**
*(leaning forward)*
Is it? Or is it just the first time anyone's told them the truth? Sir, I've been teaching for twenty years. I know what works. Trust me.

*The principal hesitates. There's something in her confidence that's unsettling, but also convincing.*

**PRINCIPAL**
I'll give you one semester. But I'm monitoring this closely.

**MS. RANDOM**
That's all I ask.

*She stands, collecting her materials. As she leaves, she glances back at the principal—a cold, calculated look.*

---

## INT. HARRISON COLLEGE - HALLWAY - DAY

*NCTEJ=7/ walks through the college hallway, her substitute teacher badge clipped to her jacket. She passes FELONIOUS (28), who's dressed in administrative attire. They exchange a brief nod—a signal.*

*NCTEJ enters a classroom where she's supposed to teach algebra. The PROFESSOR (52, respected, experienced) is at the front of the room.*

**PROFESSOR**
Class, this is Ms. Nctej. She'll be assisting with the curriculum this semester.

*NCTEJ smiles at the class.*

**NCTEJ=7/**
I'm excited to help you all learn that traditional mathematics is just another system designed to control how you think.

*The professor looks shocked.*

**PROFESSOR**
That's not—

**NCTEJ=7/**
*(interrupting, to the students)*
Don't let outdated teaching methods limit your potential. Question everything you're told.

*She sits in the back of the classroom, watching the professor's discomfort with satisfaction.*

---

## INT. HARRISON COLLEGE - PROFESSOR'S OFFICE - LATER

*The PROFESSOR meets with FELONIOUS.*

**PROFESSOR**
That woman is undermining everything I teach. She's telling students that mathematics is a tool of oppression.

**FELONIOUS**
Perhaps you should consider a different approach to your pedagogy.

**PROFESSOR**
I've been teaching for thirty years. I don't need—

*FELONIOUS stands, coldly.*

**FELONIOUS**
The college is evolving. Either evolve with it, or we'll find someone who will.

*The professor realizes the threat. FELONIOUS leaves, leaving him in shocked silence.*

---

## INT. HEALING MINDS THERAPY CENTER - INTAKE OFFICE - DAY

*VICTORIA (36) sits across from the CENTER'S DIRECTOR (54) during her first week. She's reviewing intake forms.*

**VICTORIA**
I've already scheduled sixteen new clients for this month. There's clearly a lot of demand.

**DIRECTOR**
That's impressive. Most new therapists take time to build a practice.

**VICTORIA**
I believe in working efficiently. People are suffering. They need help immediately.

*She smiles warmly, but her eyes are calculating.*

**VICTORIA** *(continuing)*
I've also been thinking about our medication recommendations. I'd like to propose we prescribe more proactively. Many patients benefit from pharmaceutical intervention even before therapy begins.

**DIRECTOR**
That's not standard practice.

**VICTORIA**
Standard practice isn't helping people. Progressive practice will.

*The director nods slowly, convinced by her confidence.*

---

## INT. HEALING MINDS THERAPY CENTER - THERAPY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

*VICTORIA's first client, MARCUS (not the Zorch Group member—a different person), sits across from her. He looks anxious.*

**VICTORIA**
Tell me about your anxiety.

**MARCUS**
*(hesitating)*
I... I'm not sure. It's just... I wake up worried about everything.

**VICTORIA**
That sounds exhausting. I think we should start you on something to help.

*She writes a prescription.*

**VICTORIA** *(continuing)*
This will help you relax. It's also important that you see me three times a week so we can monitor your progress.

**MARCUS**
Three times? That's quite often.

**VICTORIA**
Trust me. The structure of regular sessions is part of your healing. I'll need to be your anchor while you work through this.

*MARCUS accepts the prescription and the appointment card, already feeling dependent.*

---

## INT. INDUSTRIAL WAREHOUSE - LABORATORY SPACE - NIGHT

*YANNARIS (30) works frantically at his lab bench. He's surrounded by research papers, chemical catalogs, and handwritten formulas. A HANDLER from The Zorch Group stands in the corner.*

**YANNARIS**
I've been researching compound structures. If I can synthesize variations of existing drugs, I can create compounds that hit different neurological pathways.

**HANDLER**
Explain.

**YANNARIS**
Different demographics will be vulnerable to different substances. Teenagers respond to stimulants. Adults with job stress respond to depressants. Elderly respond to pain medications. By 2029, I can have a drug for every market segment.

**HANDLER**
And the College Bus?

**YANNARIS**
I'm designing it now. Mobile distribution. It can move through neighborhoods, schools, parks. No one will see it coming.

*The handler hands him an envelope.*

**HANDLER**
This is your funding for phase one. Research materials, initial manufacturing equipment. Use it wisely.

**YANNARIS**
*(taking the envelope)*
This is more than I imagined. What's the catch?

**HANDLER**
No catch. You work for us. You execute the plan. By 2029, you'll be the most successful pharmaceutical entrepreneur in history.

*YANNARIS's eyes gleam with ambition and madness.*

---

## INT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT - INVESTMENT FIRM - DAY

*JAMES (24) sits at a desk surrounded by economic textbooks, market analysis reports, and computer screens displaying financial data. MARCUS (51) approaches.*

**MARCUS**
Your first week. What have you learned?

**JAMES**
The economy is more fragile than people think. If coordinated pressure is applied across multiple sectors simultaneously—housing, employment, credit—the entire system could collapse.

**MARCUS**
Could?

**JAMES**
Will. It will collapse. I've run the models seventeen times. Every scenario shows systemic failure by 2029 if we execute properly.

**MARCUS**
Good. Here's your first assignment.

*He hands JAMES a file labeled "OPERATION ECONOMIC COLLAPSE: PHASE ONE"*

**MARCUS** *(continuing)*
Start building relationships with hedge fund managers, investment bankers, real estate developers. People who can move money quietly. People who can short markets without attracting attention. By 2029, they'll all be wealthy. The rest of the world will be poor.

**JAMES**
How do they not suspect what we're doing?

**MARCUS**
Greed is the best mask. They'll think they're just making smart financial moves. They won't realize they're part of something larger until it's too late.

*JAMES nods, understanding the beautiful cruelty of the plan.*

---

## INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

*DAVID sits at the head of the table. The other 17 members file in—this is their monthly status report meeting. One month after the initial commitment.*

*DAVID checks his watch. His expression is unreadable.*

**DAVID**
Report. Ms. Random?

*A screen flickers on, showing footage of MS. RANDOM's classroom. Students are passively receiving anti-authority messaging.*

**DAVID** *(continuing)*
Good. Nctej?

*Another screen shows NCTEJ disrupting the college classroom.*

**DAVID** *(continuing)*
Progress. Victoria?

*A third screen shows VICTORIA's intake forms—already 16 new clients, all beginning medication regimens.*

**DAVID** *(continuing)*
Efficient. Yannaris?

*The final screen shows YANNARIS's laboratory notes and drug compound designs.*

**DAVID** *(continuing)*
Ambitious. James?

*JAMES stands.*

**JAMES**
I've made contact with six major hedge fund managers. They're interested in our... investment opportunities. I project that by month six, we'll have sufficient capital movement in place to begin phase two of the economic manipulation.

**DAVID**
Timeline?

**JAMES**
Eleven years, as planned. 2029. The collapse will be spectacular.

*DAVID nods, satisfied.*

**DAVID**
The Sprunkis are still unaware?

**VERA**
Completely. They're living their normal lives. But they're intelligent. Eventually, they'll begin to see the patterns. When that happens, we'll be ready.

**DAVID**
We need them to see just enough to become curious. Then we need them to become trapped. Their desperation will make them useful.

*The room falls silent. Everyone understands the scope of what they're building.*

**DAVID** *(continuing)*
Eleven years. By 2029, every institution will be corrupted. Every system will be compromised. And society will collapse under the weight of our plan.

*He stands, addressing the entire room.*

**DAVID**
You are the architects of the new world. Go. Execute. Return with results.*

## INT. HARRISON COLLEGE - ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE - DAY

*NCTEJ=7/ (23, ambitious, dressed sharply despite her young age) sits across from the current DEAN (58, traditional, tired). This is an interview. NCTEJ is applying for a position as a substitute math teacher.*

*FELONIOUS CHARGES (28, military posture, severe) stands in the corner, watching silently. She's been placed here to oversee NCTEJ's integration.*

**DEAN**
Your credentials are... impressive. But you're very young for this role.

**NCTEJ=7/**
I have big ideas about how to modernize mathematics education. Traditional methods are holding students back.

**DEAN**
We value tradition here. It's part of our strength.

**NCTEJ=7/**
*(leaning forward)*
With respect, sir, tradition is the problem. Students need to be taught that old systems are failures.

*The Dean looks uncomfortable. FELONIOUS steps forward slightly.*

**FELONIOUS**
I think we should give her a chance. Fresh perspectives are valuable.

**DEAN**
*(sighing)*
Alright. You start Monday.

*NCTEJ=7/ smiles. FELONIOUS nods. The trap has been set.*

---

## INT. HEALING MINDS THERAPY CENTER - OFFICE - DAY

*VICTORIA (36, professional, warm smile) sits across from the CENTER'S DIRECTOR (54, skeptical). She's interviewing for a therapist position.*

**DIRECTOR**
Your approach seems... unconventional.

**VICTORIA**
I believe in creating dependency on therapeutic intervention. When people rely on me, they're more likely to follow my guidance.

**DIRECTOR**
That's not how therapy works.

**VICTORIA**
Isn't it? People want to be told what to do. They want someone to make them feel safe. I provide that.

*The director looks uncertain, but something in VICTORIA's confidence sways him.*

**DIRECTOR**
You can start next month. But I'm watching you.

**VICTORIA**
*(standing, extending her hand)*
You won't regret this.

*They shake hands. VICTORIA's smile doesn't waver.*

---

## INT. DRUG MANUFACTURING FACILITY - UNDERGROUND LABORATORY - NIGHT

*The space is industrial and cold. Beakers, tubes, and chemical equipment line the walls. YANNARIS (41, gaunt, obsessive) moves through the space like a man possessed, checking measurements, adjusting formulas.*

*Several WORKERS in hazmat suits move silently around him, following his instructions with mechanical precision.*

**YANNARIS**
*(to himself, muttering)*
The college kids first. Then the high school dropouts. Then the suburbs. Then the rural areas. Every demographic. Every weakness.

*He holds up a vial of crystalline substance, examining it in the light.*

**YANNARIS** *(continuing)*
By 2030, ninety percent of the population will be addicted to at least one of these compounds. They won't even know what they're taking half the time.

*A WORKER approaches.*

**WORKER**
The College Bus is ready. As requested.

*YANNARIS nods, satisfied.*

**YANNARIS**
Good. We move it to Harrison High next week. Start with the vulnerable ones.

---

## INT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT - INVESTMENT FIRM - DAY

*JAMES (44, suited, cold) sits in a glass-walled office overlooking the city. Computer screens display stock market data, cryptocurrency charts, and economic indicators—all trending downward.*

*MARCUS (62, graying, still sharp) enters, closing the door behind him.*

**JAMES**
It's happening faster than we predicted.

**MARCUS**
The economy?

**JAMES**
Everything. The market is about to crash. Housing is collapsing. Unemployment is rising. People are panicking.

*MARCUS sits down, a slight smile on his face.*

**MARCUS**
Perfect. The timeline is accelerating beautifully. David will be pleased.

**JAMES**
What about the military base in Houston Mexico? Are the Jammbonians prepared?

**MARCUS**
They're ready. Once the collapse becomes official—once the government admits the economy is in free fall—we activate them. They'll secure the facility. When the nation fractures, they'll be in control of a strategic stronghold.

*JAMES nods, turning back to his screens.*

**JAMES**
And The Sprunkis?

**MARCUS**
They're watching the news right now, I'm sure. They're starting to piece things together. Soon they'll try to do something about it.

**JAMES**
And then?

**MARCUS**
*(standing)*
And then we trap them. Just like we always planned.

## INT. SPRUNKIS' RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

*The house is comfortable and warm. BRANDON, SIMON, CHARLOTTE, SKY, OWAKCX, VINERIA, TUNNER, RADDY, JORDAN, and BRUD sit together on the couch, watching television.*

*They're relaxed, unaware of anything unusual. A show plays on the screen—something light, harmless.*

*SIMON yawns.*

**SIMON**
Another Friday night. Same as always.

**CHARLOTTE**
I like it that way. Predictable is good.

*They continue watching, content in their normalcy.*

*The camera pulls back, showing them through the window of their home. Warm light spills out onto the street.*

*Outside, in the shadows, a FIGURE watches them. It's one of The Zorch Group's handlers, making note of their location, their routine.*

*The figure takes a photograph of the house and walks away into the darkness.*

*Inside, the Sprunkis have no idea they're being watched. They have no idea what's coming.

---

## INT. SPRUNKIS' RESIDENCE - BRANDON'S ROOM - NIGHT

*BRANDON (17) sits at his desk, doing homework. His room is neat—posters on the walls, books on shelves, a sense of order.*

*His phone buzzes. A text from SIMON: "You watching the news?"*

*BRANDON picks up the remote and turns on his television. He flips to the news.*

**NEWS ANCHOR** *(on screen)*
...new curriculum standards are being implemented across the state. Teachers are reporting increased student questioning of authority figures...

*BRANDON watches, mildly interested but not concerned. This seems normal.*

*The news anchor continues.*

**NEWS ANCHOR**
In other news, the college admission rates continue to decline. Educators are baffled by the trend...

*BRANDON changes the channel, losing interest.*
