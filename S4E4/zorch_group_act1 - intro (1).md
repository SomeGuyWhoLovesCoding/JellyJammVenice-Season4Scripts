# THE ZORCH GROUP
## Season 4, Episode 4 - Extended Opening Scene

---

## INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - CONCRETE CORRIDOR - NIGHT
## 2018

*The hallway is dimly lit, with exposed pipes running along the ceiling. The walls are unmarked and featureless. FOOTSTEPS echo as the 18 members file in silently, one by one, from different entrances. They know not to arrive together.*

*DAVID (67) arrives last, walking slowly, deliberately. The others part to let him pass.*

---

## INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

*The room is austere and sterile—concrete walls, a long metal table, and a single overhead light casting harsh shadows. The 18 individuals take their seats in a predetermined order. A leather chair at the head of the table sits empty, waiting.*

*The camera pans across their faces as they wait in tense silence. A calendar on the wall reads: OCTOBER 2018.*

*DAVID sits in the only chair that faces the entire room—not at the head of the table, but slightly above it. A position of power without ceremony.*

**MARCUS** *(45, sharp-eyed, military bearing)*
They're late again.

**ELENA** *(32, fingers drumming on the table)*
They're always late. It's part of the whole... thing.

**DAVID** *(weathered face, speaks quietly)*
Patience. The structure demands it.

*A younger member, KYLE (23), shifts nervously in his seat. Across from him, VERA (58, ice-cold demeanor) stares straight ahead without blinking. She doesn't acknowledge Kyle's anxiety—it's beneath her notice.*

**MARCUS**
How many this quarter?

**SARAH** *(41, reviewing papers in a leather folder)*
Seven institutional targets. Three individuals directly compromised. One continental operation greenlit.

*THOMAS (56) nods approvingly. Next to him, JADE (29) takes notes with mechanical precision, her pen moving without hesitation.*

**KYLE**
*(hesitant)*
Are we sure about Yannaris? He seemed... unstable.

*The room goes quiet. All eyes turn to Kyle. The silence is deafening.*

**VERA**
Instability is leverage.

**MARCUS**
The man will do exactly what he's told because he believes it's his choice.

**LEO** *(38, leaning back in his chair)*
That's the beauty of it. They all do.

*NINA (26) and OSCAR (55) exchange a brief glance of understanding. They've seen this play out before.*

**DAVID**
Ms. Random was resistant at first.

**SARAH**
She came around. They always do. Once you show them the path, they walk it themselves. No more intervention needed after that.

*CHEN (34) speaks up, his voice calm and measured.*

**CHEN**
The college system is more fragile than we anticipated. Nctej is already creating the rifts we need. The administration is fracturing beautifully.

**MARCUS**
Good. Felonious?

**ROBERT** *(61, scratches his chin)*
Felonious is holding position at the college. She knows her role. She's exactly where we need her.

*VICTORIA (47, stiff posture) makes a note herself—she's already in the field, corrupting the therapy sector from within.*

*The camera focuses on the empty chair at the head of the table. No one acknowledges it.*

**JAMES** *(31, younger, idealistic-looking but cold)*
The Jammbonians are being positioned. They're ready for the Houston Mexico facility when the collapse accelerates.

**MARGARET** *(59, speaks with quiet authority)*
2029 is sooner than people think. Eleven years from now. We need them ready by then. Every piece must be in place.

*PATRICIA (24, the youngest besides Kyle) raises her hand slightly.*

**PATRICIA**
What about the Sprunkis? They've been... quiet.

*A pause. The room's energy shifts slightly. A smile crosses VERA's face—cold, calculated.*

**VERA**
They won't be for long.

**MARCUS**
They're not on the list yet.

**VERA**
Not officially. But they're connected to everything. They see too much. Eventually, they'll become a problem. When they do, we'll be ready.

*ELENA nods in agreement.*

**ELENA**
They're watching. They're always watching the news. That will be their undoing.

*DAVID stands slowly, commanding attention without raising his voice. Everyone sits straighter.*

**DAVID**
Eleven years. From this moment until 2029, we execute this plan with absolute precision. No deviations. No mercy. No hesitation.

*He walks to a wall and taps it. A map appears on a hidden screen, showing interconnected lines between different cities, institutions, and photographs of faces—some of them familiar, some not.*

**DAVID** *(continuing)*
High school. College. Therapy. Military. Economics. Politics. Healthcare. We touch them all. One by one, we screw the world over—and they'll thank us for it because they won't even know we're doing it.

*The camera pulls back, showing all 18 faces now lit by the soft glow of the map. Their expressions are unified. They are believers.*

**MARCUS**
The next phase begins Monday.

**SARAH**
Ms. Random is ready to implement the curriculum changes. She'll start small. Rewriting standards. Changing how students think about authority.

**CHEN**
Nctej will backstab whoever we tell her to backstab. We've already planted the seeds of ambition in her. She's hungry for power. She'll do anything to keep climbing.

**JAMES**
The economy is rigged to collapse exactly when we need it to. The market doesn't know it yet, but we've already positioned ourselves. When 2029 arrives, the fall will be catastrophic.

**ROBERT**
Felonious will tear down the college from the inside. She'll replace integrity with corruption. Education will crumble.

**VERA** *(stands now, moving to the map)*
And when people are desperate, scared, confused in 2029—that's when they're most useful. Eleven years to plant the seeds. Eleven years to watch it all grow into something beautiful.

*She points at different locations on the map.*

**VERA** *(continuing)*
Yannaris will have flooded the continent with drugs by then. Victoria's therapy networks will have created dependency, not healing. Ms. Random's students will be taught to distrust everything. The college will be a factory for broken minds.

**OSCAR**
And the Jammbonians will have the military base secured. Houston Mexico will be a stronghold when the nation falls apart.

*The room falls silent. The weight of their collective intention hangs in the air like smoke.*

*The camera slowly zooms in on the map, showing the connections between all their targets, the intricate web they've already begun to weave. Each line represents years of planning. Each name represents a human they've corrupted.*

**NINA**
What about The Sprunkis when they become a problem?

*DAVID turns, his eyes dark.*

**DAVID**
When they become a problem, we'll have them exactly where we want them. They'll be trapped. And they'll be useful too.

**DAVID** *(continuing, addressing the entire room)*
We are The Zorch Group. We are everywhere. We are patient. And we are unstoppable.

*He turns back to the map, his silhouette against the glowing screen.*

**DAVID**
We began this work years ago. But tonight, we commit to the final phase. Eleven years. One hundred and thirty-two months. Four thousand and one hundred days until the world falls.

*He taps the map. It zooms in on a calendar—October 2018 marked clearly, with a line extending to 2029.*

**DAVID**
This is where it starts. This is where we plant the final seeds.

*ELENA speaks, her voice calm.*

**ELENA**
And no one will see us coming.

*The room murmurs in agreement. A ritualistic affirmation.*

**DAVID**
Dismissed. Each of you knows your role. Execute. Report back in thirty days.

*The 18 members stand in unison, filing out as silently as they came in. DAVID remains, staring at the map. At 2029.*

*The lights cut to black.*

*A single word appears on screen in white text:*

**THE ZORCH GROUP**

*The date appears below it:*

**OCTOBER 2018**

*Then another line:*

**2029 - 11 YEARS TO COLLAPSE**
