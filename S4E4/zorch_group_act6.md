## INT. MALL - GROCERY STORE - DAY
## One Week After s04e02 and s04e03
## October 2029

*The grocery store is nearly fully restored. New shelves line the walls. Fresh products stock the aisles. Construction equipment is being removed. Opening day is imminent.*

*BELLO (36, weathered but hopeful) and MAY (31, sharp-eyed) are working the floor, helping to arrange final displays. They're wearing employee vests now—they've successfully been rehired.*

*MR. GORDON (50s, manager) approaches with a wireless tablet displaying a news feed.*

**MR. GORDON**  
*(handing the tablet to Bello)*  
You should see this. Economic news.

*BELLO and MAY crowd around the tablet. On the screen, a NEWS ANCHOR speaks with controlled urgency.*

**NEWS ANCHOR** *(on tablet screen)*  
...in unprecedented economic news, the Federal Reserve has announced a halt to all trading. Markets have officially crashed. The Dow Jones has lost 87% of its value in the past six hours. We are now officially in what economists are calling "The Great Collapse of 2029."

*BELLO's face goes pale. MAY grabs his arm.*

**NEWS ANCHOR** *(continuing on screen)*  
All major financial institutions have suspended operations. Credit systems have failed. The dollar is essentially worthless. Government agencies are overwhelmed with emergency calls. Experts are calling this the worst financial catastrophe in human history.

*MR. GORDON takes the tablet back, his own expression troubled.*

**MR. GORDON**  
I don't understand. The economy was fine last week. How does something like this happen overnight?

**MAY**  
*(to Bello, quietly)*  
This is real. This is actually happening.

*Before BELLO can respond, the front door of the grocery store FLIES OPEN.*

*GOOMO (33, imposing presence), RITA (28, sharp features), MINA (25, alert), MARIA (40, authoritative), NATALIE (29, stern), MR. HOLT (58, professorial), and a HIGH SECURITY DETECTIVE (45, official bearing, serious expression) rush into the store.*

*All eyes in the grocery store turn toward them.*

**BELLO**  
*(shocked)*  
Goomo? Rita? Maria?

*MARIA sees BELLO and MAY. Her expression is grave, worried.*

**MARIA**  
Bello. We need to talk to you. Now.

**BELLO**  
What's wrong? What happened?

*The group gathers in a corner of the store, away from other customers and employees. The DETECTIVE's presence makes it clear this is serious.*

**GOOMO**  
We have news. About Semmi.

*BELLO's jaw tightens.*

**BELLO**  
What about him?

**RITA**  
He's disappeared. Three days ago. Vanished without a trace.

*MAY's hand instinctively finds BELLO's.*

**MAY**  
Disappeared? What do you mean disappeared?

**MINA**  
No one's seen him. Not at his house. Not at his workplace. We've searched everywhere. It's like he just... ceased to exist.

*MR. HOLT steps forward, his expression deeply troubled.*

**MR. HOLT**  
We went back to his house yesterday morning. The police were already there. When we arrived, everyone was confused. Disoriented. No one could remember what happened that night. It's as if their memories of that evening had been erased.

*BELLO exchanges a confused glance with MAY.*

**BELLO**  
Memories? Erased? That's not possible.

*The HIGH SECURITY DETECTIVE steps forward, pulling out his badge.*

**DETECTIVE**  
Detective Harrison with the Federal Investigation Bureau. I'm investigating Semmi's disappearance. And I have to tell you—we have no leads. No evidence. No trace. His apartment is empty. His financial records show no activity. It's as if someone deliberately erased all trace of him from the system.

**NATALIE**  
We came here looking for you because you were supposed to be part of all this. Part of that night. But when we tried to piece together what happened, we realized... we couldn't remember clearly either. Fragments. Pieces. But nothing concrete.

*MARIA looks directly at BELLO.*

**MARIA**  
Bello, you were there. You were outside. Do you remember what happened? Do you remember Semmi?

**BELLO**  
*(hesitating)*  
I... yes. I remember. He was... he was controlling everyone. He was dangerous. May and I got away because we left early.

**DETECTIVE**  
And when did you last see him?

**BELLO**  
That night. In his house. Then May and I drove away.

*The DETECTIVE makes notes, but his expression shows frustration.*

**DETECTIVE**  
The problem is, we have no physical evidence of Semmi's existence after that night. No footage. No records. The house itself—when we arrived to investigate—it was clean. Too clean. Like someone scrubbed it.

**GOOMO**  
And now the economy's collapsing. Out of nowhere. On the same day Semmi disappeared.

*They all feel it—the weight of coincidence, the sense that something massive and coordinated is happening.*

*MR. GORDON, who has been observing from near the register, approaches cautiously.*

**MR. GORDON**  
I apologize for eavesdropping, but... is someone missing? Should I call additional police?

**DETECTIVE**  
*(showing his badge)*  
Federal Investigation Bureau. We're handling this. Thank you for your concern.

*The DETECTIVE turns back to BELLO and the group.*

**DETECTIVE**  
Here's what concerns me. We have a missing person with no trace. We have a global economic collapse that happened simultaneously with his disappearance. And we have multiple people with fragmentary memories of the night in question. That's not a coincidence. That's a pattern.

**RITA**  
A pattern of what?

**DETECTIVE**  
I don't know yet. But I intend to find out.

*He hands cards to everyone present.*

**DETECTIVE** *(continuing)*  
If you remember anything—anything at all—about that night, about Semmi, about anything unusual, contact me immediately. This case is now classified as a missing persons investigation with federal implications.

*Outside the store windows, the reality of the economic collapse becomes more apparent. People rush past. Sirens wail. A news broadcast plays on a store monitor: emergency announcements, government statements, financial experts in panic mode.*

**MAY**  
*(quietly to Bello)*  
This doesn't make sense. None of this makes sense.

**BELLO**  
I know.

**MARIA**  
We just... we came here to tell you. To warn you. To see if you knew anything.

**BELLO**  
I don't. I wish I did. I wish I could help.

*The DETECTIVE stands in the middle of the grocery store—surrounded by confusion, by missing pieces, by a mystery that extends far beyond a single missing person.*

**DETECTIVE**  
*(to the group, gravely)*  
Something very large is happening. Semmi's disappearance is just one piece. The economy collapsing is another. And somewhere, someone is responsible for both. My job is to find out who.

*He looks at each of them.*

**DETECTIVE** *(continuing)*  
And I will find out who.

*But in his eyes, there's uncertainty. Fear. The knowledge that he's investigating something beyond his understanding.*

*The camera pans across the faces in the store: BELLO and MAY, concerned and confused; GOOMO, RITA, MINA, and NATALIE, worried and lost; MR. HOLT, troubled and aged by what he's experienced; MR. GORDON, bewildered by the chaos unfolding in his restored grocery store; and the DETECTIVE, professional but deeply unsettled.*

*Outside, chaos continues. Sirens. Shouting. The collapse accelerating.*

*The camera moves to the windows of the grocery store, showing the world beyond—a society fragmenting, an economy crumbling, answers nowhere to be found.*

*Finally, the camera focuses back inside, on all the faces—trapped in a moment of profound uncertainty, unable to comprehend the forces that have been set in motion.*

*Text appears on screen:*

**THE ZORCH GROUP - SEASON 4, EPISODE 4 - THE END**

**BUT THE COLLAPSE HAS ONLY JUST BEGUN**

**AND THE TRUTH REMAINS HIDDEN**

**SEASON 5: THE AFTERMATH - COMING SOON**

*Fade to black.*

*The sound of sirens and distant chaos fades as the episode ends in complete darkness.*
