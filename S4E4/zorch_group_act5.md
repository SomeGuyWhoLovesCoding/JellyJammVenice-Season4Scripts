## INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - HOLDING AREA - NIGHT
## One Week Later

*The Sprunkis have been imprisoned for seven days. They're exhausted, demoralized, but not broken.*

*BRANDON sits with the others, whispering their plan.*

**BRANDON**
I've figured something out. When we were in that hangar before we escaped, I saw something on the wall. A terminal. An access point.

**SIMON**
To what?

**BRANDON**
To everything. The Zorch Group's records. Their operations. Their memory systems. If we can get back there, if we can access that terminal...

**CHARLOTTE**
We could wipe them. We could make them forget we ever existed.

**OWAKCX**
That's insane. How do we even get back there?

**BRANDON**
The same way we tried to escape before. Through the ventilation system. But this time, we're not running. We're executing.

*They prepare. SIMON finds a loose panel in the wall of their cell. RADDY uses metal from a broken bunk to pry it open.*

*The panel gives way, revealing a ventilation shaft.*

**SIMON**
It's narrow, but we can fit.

*One by one, they crawl through the vent. It's cramped, suffocating, but they push forward.*

---

## INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - VENTILATION SYSTEM - CONTINUOUS

*They crawl through the metal ducts, the sound of their movement echoing.*

*BRUD reaches a junction and finds an exit. He pushes through and emerges into—*

---

## INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - SERVER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

*They tumble out into a massive server room. Walls of computer equipment line the space. Servers hum with the accumulated data of The Zorch Group's operations.*

*BRANDON rushes to the main terminal.*

**BRANDON**
This is it. This is their memory. Their records. Everything.

*His fingers fly across the keyboard. He's intuitive with this technology—as if something in his alien nature recognizes it.*

**SIMON**
How long do you need?

**BRANDON**
Five minutes. Maybe less.

*CHARLOTTE stands guard at the door.*

**CHARLOTTE**
We've got company coming. I can hear them in the corridors.

**BRANDON**
*(typing frantically)*
Almost there... almost... there!

*He hits enter. The screens flicker. Red text appears: "MEMORY WIPE PROTOCOL INITIATED."*

**COMPUTER VOICE**
Erasing all records of Uranian entities. Deleting all surveillance footage. Removing all personnel files. Scrubbing all communications data.

*The servers begin to hum louder. Lights flicker across the equipment.*

**BRANDON**
It's working. It's all working.

*The armed figures are getting closer. Their footsteps echo through the corridors.*

**BRUD**
They're almost here!

**COMPUTER VOICE**
Memory wipe: 87% complete.

**BRANDON**
Come on, come on...

**COMPUTER VOICE**
Memory wipe: 100% complete. All records of Uranian entities successfully erased from The Zorch Group's systems.

*BRANDON turns to the others.*

**BRANDON**
Go! Now!

## INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - EXTERIOR HANGAR - CONTINUOUS

*The Sprunkis run into the hangar. Alarms are screaming now. Red lights flash everywhere.*

*Parked in the hangar is a spacecraft. Not alien-looking. Not futuristic. But unmistakably a ship designed for interstellar travel.*

**VOICE** *(over intercom)*
Escapees detected. All personnel to containment positions.

*The Sprunkis run toward the spacecraft. OWAKCX finds the entry panel and rips it open.*

**OWAKCX**
Get in! Now!

*They pile into the ship. The cockpit is intuitive—panels light up, screens activate. It's as if the ship recognizes them.*

**SIMON**
It's responding to us. It's—

*The ship begins to power up. The engines roar to life.*

*Behind them, ARMED FIGURES pour into the hangar, weapons drawn. But they hesitate, confused.*

**ARMED FIGURE 1**
*(into radio)*
Who are we looking for again? What are we doing?

**ARMED FIGURE 2**
I... I don't remember. I don't remember why we're here.

*The memory wipe has affected them too. The soldiers stand frozen, confused, their orders erased from their minds.*

*The ship begins to ascend. The hangar doors open automatically—the Sprunkis' Uranian technology recognizes its own.*

*The spacecraft launches. It pierces through the atmosphere with a thunderous crack.*

*Within seconds, it's gone.*

*In the hangar, the soldiers stand confused and disoriented. No memory of what they were defending. No knowledge of who just escaped.*

---

## EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS

*The ship breaks free from Earth's atmosphere. Below, the planet recedes. Above, the stars shine eternal.*

*Inside the cockpit, the Sprunkis stare at the view screens in complete shock.*

**SKY**
We're... we're leaving Earth.

**CHARLOTTE**
Where are we going?

*A holographic display activates. Navigation systems engage. The ship's AI speaks with a calm, mechanical voice.*

**SHIP AI**
Destination set: Uranus. Return protocol initiated. Estimated travel time: 4.2 years.

*The Sprunkis look at each other. The revelation is impossible, incomprehensible.*

**BRANDON**
We're not human. We're not from Earth.

**RADDY**
We're from Uranus.

*TUNNER sits down slowly.*

**TUNNER**
This whole time. This whole time, we didn't know.

**VINERIA**
The Zorch Group... they were trying to stop us from finding out.

*The ship accelerates, heading toward the outer planets.*

## MONTAGE - NEWS BROADCASTS (2018-2029)

### NEWS BROADCAST #1 - October 2018

**NEWS ANCHOR** *(in emergency broadcast tone)*
...breaking news from NASA and the Department of Defense. A spacecraft has been detected leaving Earth's atmosphere. We have confirmation of ten humanoid lifeforms aboard. Details are still emerging, but sources indicate these individuals may be extraterrestrial in origin...

*The footage shows the ship launching, disappearing into the stars.*

---

### NEWS BROADCAST #2 - November 2018

**NEWS ANCHOR**
The ten "Uranian visitors" have reportedly reached orbital distance. NASA confirms they are transmitting communications in a language that predates human civilization. When translated, the messages contain detailed information about a conspiracy on Earth involving an organization called "The Zorch Group."

*On screen: A translated message appears: "URANIAN COLLECTIVE TO EARTH GOVERNMENTS: BEWARE THE ZORCH GROUP. THEY SEEK TO COLLAPSE YOUR CIVILIZATION."*

---

### NEWS BROADCAST #3 - 2020

**NEWS ANCHOR**
Three months ago, the Uranians attempted to warn Earth governments about the economic collapse they predicted would occur by 2029. Government officials dismissed the warnings. Now, as their predictions have begun to materialize, world leaders are reconsidering contact with the extraterrestrial visitors.

*News footage shows economic charts declining, unemployment rising.*

---

### NEWS BROADCAST #4 - 2023

**NEWS ANCHOR**
Mysteriously, the Uranians have ceased all communications. Their spacecraft is no longer detected on NASA instruments. It's as if they vanished without a trace. Questions remain about their origin, their purpose, and why they abandoned their warnings to Earth.

*The broadcast shows confusion among scientists and government officials.*

---

### NEWS BROADCAST #5 - 2025

**NEWS ANCHOR**
The predicted collapse by the mysterious Uranian visitors is now occurring exactly as forecasted. The Zorch Group remains elusive. Government investigations into the organization have turned up no physical evidence, no clear leadership structure, no documented proof of their existence. It's as if they don't exist at all.

---

### NEWS BROADCAST #6 - 2027

**NEWS ANCHOR**
As the predicted economic collapse accelerates, historians are struggling to explain the role of The Zorch Group. Some experts suggest the organization may be purely mythological—a conspiracy theory that took on a life of its own. Others insist the group is real but has perfected the art of invisibility.

*News footage shows riots, economic chaos, healthcare system collapse.*

---

### NEWS BROADCAST #7 - 2028

**NEWS ANCHOR**
The Uranians' final transmission has been decoded by linguists. Their message: "We warned. You did not listen. By 2029, your world will enter a new age. What emerges from the collapse will determine the future of your species. Choose wisely. We return to Uranus. We leave no trace."

*The broadcast shows confusion and speculation.*

---

### NEWS BROADCAST #8 - October 2029

**NEWS ANCHOR** *(speaking urgently)*
We are now in the final days before total economic collapse. The Zorch Group's influence remains a mystery. No evidence of their operations has ever been found. No arrests have been made. No one can even prove they exist. It's as if something—or someone—erased all record of them from our systems.

*On screen: Footage of financial markets crashing, governments failing, society fragmenting.*

---

## INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - ABANDONED

*Empty. Silent. The servers are dark. The facility is being swallowed by dust and time.*

*In the command center, files are scattered, but they contain no information. No names. No plans. No memory of what happened here.*

*A single file sits on a desk, labeled "THE ZORCH GROUP" in fading letters. But when opened, it's completely blank.*

---

## INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

*DAVID sits before multiple screens showing real-time data. But the screens are going dark. One by one, they flicker and die.*

*VERA rushes in.*

**VERA**
Sir, we've lost all records. All data. All surveillance footage. Everything pertaining to—

*She stops. Her eyes go blank.*

**VERA** *(continuing, confused)*
I... I don't know why I came in here. What was I going to say?

**DAVID**
*(confused)*
I... we were doing something. Something important. What was it?

*DAVID looks at the blank screens. He tries to remember. But there's nothing. No memory. No trace of The Sprunkis. No knowledge of why this underground facility exists.*

*Around the facility, Zorch Group members wander confused. They've lost all recollection of their mission, their purpose, their organization.*

**DAVID**
I feel like I'm forgetting something. Something critical. But I can't remember what.

---

## EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS

*The Uranian spacecraft breaks free from Earth's atmosphere. Below, the planet recedes. Above, the stars shine eternal.*

*Inside the cockpit, the Sprunkis breathe a collective sigh of relief.*

**BRANDON**
We did it. We actually did it.

**CHARLOTTE**
They won't even remember we were ever here.

**SIMON**
No records. No evidence. No trace. We're ghosts.

*A holographic display activates. Navigation systems engage. The ship's AI speaks with a calm, mechanical voice.*

**SHIP AI**
Destination set: Uranus. Return protocol initiated. Estimated travel time: 4.2 years.

*The Sprunkis look at each other. The realization settles on them—they're truly free.*

**OWAKCX**
We're going home.

**RADDY**
And they'll never know we were here.

*The ship accelerates, heading toward the outer planets.*

**BRANDON**
The Zorch Group wanted to destroy a world. They almost succeeded. But we stopped them. And we did it without them ever knowing who we were.

*The camera pulls back, showing the Uranian spacecraft leaving Earth's orbit, disappearing into the cosmic void.*

---

## EXT. SAGINAW LAKE - CONTINUOUS

*NCTEJ=7/ continues swimming. Her strokes are weak. She's exhausted.*

*In the distance, the lights of the opposite shore become visible. Just a little further.*

*She keeps swimming. Struggling. Fighting. Refusing to stop.*

*Behind her, the entire continent is collapsing. Ahead of her, is the promise of escape. Or simply another shore to hide on.*

*The camera pulls back, showing her tiny figure in the vast lake, swimming toward an uncertain future.*

---

## FINAL IMAGE - SPACE

*The Uranian spacecraft continues through the cosmos, heading toward the outer planets.*

*Inside, the Sprunkis look out at the stars they're returning to.*

**BRANDON** *(voice-over)*
We came to Earth as observers. We watched them build a civilization. We watched them create an organization designed to destroy everything. And in the end, we erased the memory of it all.

**CHARLOTTE** *(voice-over)*
The Zorch Group will continue. They'll wonder why they exist. They'll have no records, no purpose, no mission. And slowly, over time, they'll dissolve into nothing.

**SIMON** *(voice-over)*
The world will collapse anyway. The economy will fail. Society will break down. But it won't be because of The Zorch Group. It will just be because human civilization is fragile. And that's a lesson they'll have to learn themselves.

*The spacecraft accelerates, leaving Earth's solar system behind.*

*Text appears on screen:*

**THE SPRUNKIS ERASED THEMSELVES FROM HISTORY**

**THE ZORCH GROUP REMAINS, BUT REMEMBERS NOTHING**

**EARTH CONTINUES WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR SALVATION**

**THE URANIANS RETURN HOME**

**NO TRACE REMAINS**

*The spacecraft becomes a speck, then disappears entirely into the darkness of space.*

*Fade to black.*

## POST-CREDITS SCENE

### INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - COMMAND CENTER - DAY
## October 2029

*DAVID stands before blank screens. Around him, the 18 members of The Zorch Group mill about, confused and disoriented.*

**DAVID**
*(to himself, troubled)*
I feel like we were supposed to do something. Something important. But I can't remember what.

**VERA**
*(approaching)*
Sir, do you know what this facility is for?

**DAVID**
I... I'm not sure anymore.

*They look at each other, lost. The organization that was going to reshape the world now exists only in shadow, with no memory of its purpose.*

*The camera pulls back, showing The Zorch Group wandering through their facility like ghosts of a purpose they no longer remember.*

*Text appears:*

**THE ZORCH GROUP PERSISTS, BUT PURPOSE FORGOTTEN**

**SEASON 5: THE AMNESIA**

*Fade to black.*
