# SEASON 4, EPISODE 2: "THE OPULENCE OF SEMMI"
## ACT THREE

### INT. SEMMI'S LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

The tension is suffocating. **SEMMI** brings plates of pasta to the cheap glass coffee table, setting them down with forced gentleness.

**SEMMI**  
*(overly cheerful)*  
Here we are! Fresh pasta! Homemade sauce! Everyone eat up!

Nobody moves.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(darker)*  
I said. Eat. Up.

Slowly, hands reach for plates. Forks pick up pasta. People eat in silence.

**MAY** sniffles, trying to eat through tears.

**SEMMI** sits on the mid-century couch, watching them all like a parent overseeing children.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
See? This is nice. This is what I wanted. All of us together. Family meal.

**MARIA**  
*(quietly)*  
Can May and I be excused? We're not very hungry.

**SEMMI**  
*(firmly)*  
You'll eat what I made. It's rude to waste food.

**MARIA**  
But we're really not—

**SEMMI**  
*(leaning forward)*  
Maria. Eat. The. Pasta.

**MARIA** picks up her fork with shaking hands.

**BELLO** puts down his fork.

**BELLO**  
Semmi, this has gone far enough. The kids are scared. We need to—

**SEMMI**  
*(standing abruptly)*  
The kids are FINE! Everyone is FINE! Why does everyone keep saying things aren't fine?! Look around! Beautiful house! Good food! Great company! Everything is PERFECT!

**NATALIE**  
*(standing slowly)*  
Semmi... I think you need to take a breath. This isn't—

**SEMMI**  
*(laughing bitterly)*  
Oh, NOW you're concerned? Now you want to tell ME what to do? In MY house?

He walks toward the kitchen, pacing.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
You know what I think? I think you all came here to JUDGE me. To see the "weird helicopter guy's weird house" and laugh about it later. "Did you see all his old stuff? Did you see how uptight he is?"

**GOOMO**  
*(standing)*  
That's not true, man. We came here because you invited us. Because we thought we were friends.

**SEMMI**  
*(spinning to face him)*  
THOUGHT? Past tense? So now we're NOT friends?

**GOOMO**  
I didn't say that—

**SEMMI**  
You implied it! THOUGHT we were friends! Like it's over! Like I did something wrong!

**RITA**  
*(standing, gentle)*  
Semmi, nobody's saying you did something wrong. We're just... we're worried about you. This behavior, it's not like you.

**SEMMI**  
*(bitterly)*  
Not like me? THIS IS ME! This has ALWAYS been me! The only difference is now you're seeing it! The real me! The me that doesn't have to pretend to be some easygoing ranger who doesn't care about anything!

He gestures wildly around the room.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
I care about EVERYTHING! Every detail! Every piece! Every schedule! And I'm TIRED of pretending I don't!

**MR. HOLT**  
*(standing, authoritative)*  
Semmi. I understand you're upset. But holding people here against their will is—

**SEMMI**  
*(interrupting)*  
Against their will? I INVITED them! They CAME! They ATE MY FOOD! And now they want to run away like I'm some kind of monster!

**NATALIE**  
We don't think you're a monster. We think you're having a hard time right now.

**SEMMI**  
*(voice breaking slightly)*  
I'm not having a hard time. I'm having a GOOD time. I'm finally being myself. Finally showing people who I really am. And you all hate it.

**BELLO**  
We don't hate it—

**SEMMI**  
Then why does everyone want to LEAVE?!

Silence.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(quieter, desperate)*  
Why does everyone always want to leave?

He sits down heavily on the mid-century couch, head in his hands.

For a moment, everyone just stares. Is he crying?

Then **PADDY BARKS** upstairs—loud, frantic, non-stop.

**SEMMI** looks up, eyes red.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(to himself)*  
Paddy. I need to... I need to deal with Paddy.

He stands, walks toward the stairs.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(turning back)*  
Nobody leaves. I'll be right back. Nobody. Leaves.

He goes upstairs.

The moment he's gone, everyone speaks in urgent whispers.

**BELLO**  
We need to go. NOW.

**GOOMO**  
What about the kids?

**RITA**  
We take them with us. Obviously.

**MR. HOLT**  
Should we call someone? The police?

**NATALIE**  
And say what? He hasn't technically done anything illegal. He's just... unwell.

**BELLO**  
He grabbed Mina's wrist. He threatened us. That's enough.

From upstairs: **SHOUTING**. **SEMMI** yelling at Paddy. The dog **BARKING** louder.

**MARIA**  
*(scared)*  
What's he doing to his dog?

**MAY**  
*(crying harder)*  
I want to go home!

**RITA**  
*(to May and Maria)*  
It's okay. We're leaving. Right now.

**BELLO** moves toward the door.

**BELLO**  
Come on. Everyone. Quietly.

They all stand, moving toward the front door.

**GOOMO** reaches for the doorknob.

It's **LOCKED**. Deadbolt.

**GOOMO**  
*(testing it)*  
It's locked. He locked us in.

**NATALIE**  
Find the key. Check the hooks, the table—

They frantically search. No key visible.

From upstairs: A **YELP** from Paddy. Then silence.

Then **SEMMI**'s footsteps on the stairs.

**BELLO**  
*(urgent whisper)*  
Back to your seats! Now!

Everyone scrambles back to where they were, sitting down just as **SEMMI** appears at the bottom of the stairs.

He's breathing heavily. Scratches on his arms. His cardigan is torn slightly.

**SEMMI**  
*(panting)*  
Paddy's... settled. He's fine now.

**GOOMO**  
*(carefully)*  
Are YOU okay? You're bleeding.

**SEMMI** looks down at his arms.

**SEMMI**  
He got excited. Scratched me. It's fine. He's in his crate now. Calm.

He walks to the kitchen area, runs his arms under water.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(not looking at them)*  
Did anyone try to leave?

Silence.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(turning, water still running)*  
I asked a question. Did. Anyone. Try. To. Leave?

**BELLO**  
*(lying)*  
No. We stayed. Like you asked.

**SEMMI** studies him for a long moment.

**SEMMI**  
Good. That's good. Because leaving would be... disappointing. After everything we've shared today.

He dries his arms on a vintage dishtowel, carefully hanging it back exactly where it was.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
You know what? I think we need a change of pace. Something fun. Interactive.

**NATALIE**  
Semmi, maybe we should all just—

**SEMMI**  
*(ignoring her)*  
I have an idea! Let's watch something together. A movie! Or a documentary! I have a wonderful collection!

**MR. HOLT**  
Actually, I really do need to get going. I have an appointment—

**SEMMI**  
*(sharply)*  
Cancel it.

**MR. HOLT**  
I can't just—

**SEMMI**  
*(walking toward him)*  
Mr. Holt. You came to MY house. You ate MY food. You drank MY coffee. The LEAST you can do is stay for a movie.

**MR. HOLT**  
*(standing his ground)*  
Semmi, I'm leaving. Unlock the door.

**SEMMI**  
No.

**MR. HOLT**  
*(firmly)*  
Unlock. The door.

**SEMMI**  
*(getting agitated)*  
Why is everyone so desperate to leave?! What's wrong with my house?! What's wrong with ME?!

**MARIA**  
*(standing, brave)*  
You're being mean! And scary! That's what's wrong!

**SEMMI** turns to her, something breaking in his expression.

**SEMMI**  
*(quietly)*  
Mean? I'm being... mean?

**MARIA**  
*(nodding)*  
You won't let us leave. You yelled at Mina. You hurt your dog. You're acting like a bad person.

**SEMMI** stares at her.

**SEMMI**  
*(voice shaking)*  
I'm not a bad person. I'm just... particular. Organized. There's nothing wrong with that.

**MARIA**  
There is when you're being mean to people.

**MAY**  
*(quietly)*  
I don't like you anymore.

Something in **SEMMI** snaps.

**SEMMI**  
FINE! You want to see mean? I'll SHOW you mean!

He strides to the kitchen, grabs **TWO HIGH CHAIRS** from a closet—old, vintage, meant for toddlers.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(to Maria and May)*  
Since you're acting like CHILDREN, you can SIT like children!

**BELLO**  
*(standing)*  
Absolutely not. Semmi, stop—

**SEMMI**  
*(pointing at Bello)*  
SIT DOWN!

**BELLO** hesitates, then sits. He's scared now.

**SEMMI** sets up the high chairs.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(to May)*  
You. Here. Now.

**MAY**  
*(crying)*  
No!

**RITA**  
*(standing)*  
She's eight years old! You can't—

**SEMMI**  
I CAN! This is MY HOUSE!

**GOOMO** stands up, stepping between **SEMMI** and **MAY**.

**GOOMO**  
That's enough, man. You need to back off.

**SEMMI**  
*(laughing)*  
Or what? You'll fight me? In my own home? Please. Try it.

**GOOMO** hesitates. **SEMMI** is unhinged enough that violence feels genuinely possible.

**MARIA**  
*(stepping forward)*  
I'll sit. I'll sit in the chair. Just leave May alone.

**SEMMI**  
*(turning to her)*  
Both of you. That's the deal.

**MARIA**  
Fine.

She walks to one of the high chairs. Tries to sit. It's uncomfortable—she's 13, too big for it.

**MAY** doesn't move.

**SEMMI**  
*(to May)*  
NOW.

**RITA**  
*(to May, gently)*  
It's okay, honey. Just for a minute. I'm right here.

**MAY**, crying, walks to the other high chair. Climbs in.

**SEMMI** steps back, looking at them.

**SEMMI**  
There. Perfect. Now you can think about how you speak to people.

**MARIA** shifts uncomfortably in the high chair, trying to adjust. Her face contorts in pain/discomfort.

**MARIA**  
*(quietly, embarrassed)*  
This... this really hurts.

**SEMMI**  
Good. Maybe you'll think twice before—

**MARIA**  
*(voice breaking)*  
No, I mean... it really hurts. The chair. It's... it's pressing wrong.

She shifts again, clearly in physical pain.

**RITA**  
*(concerned)*  
Maria, what's wrong?

**MARIA**  
*(face red, near tears from embarrassment)*  
I... I can't... I can't fix it in here. I can't adjust...

**BELLO**  
*(standing)*  
Semmi, let her out. She's in pain.

**MARIA**  
*(quietly, mortified)*  
It's because... I'm... I'm transgender. The chair is... it's hurting me. I can't... I can't sit right.

Silence. Everyone stares - some in sympathy, some in shock that she had to reveal this.

**SEMMI** stares at her for a long moment.

**SEMMI**  
*(coldly)*  
You're... what?

**MARIA**  
*(crying now from embarrassment and pain)*  
I'm a transgender girl. Please, the chair is really hurting—

**SEMMI** steps forward and pulls her out of the high chair roughly.

**SEMMI** steps forward and pulls her out of the high chair roughly.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(disgusted)*  
You need to go somewhere else. You don't... you shouldn't be sitting with...

He looks at **MAY**, then back at **MARIA**.

**BELLO**  
*(standing, angry)*  
Don't you dare. She just told you something personal, something painful, and you're going to—

**SEMMI**  
*(interrupting)*  
She needs to go somewhere quiet. Where she can think about her behavior.

**NATALIE**  
This is because she's trans. You're punishing her because—

**SEMMI**  
*(sharply)*  
I'm not punishing anyone! I'm just... this isn't appropriate. She shouldn't be in the same chair as May. It's not right.

**GOOMO**  
*(standing)*  
What the hell is wrong with you?!

**SEMMI**  
*(defensive)*  
Nothing is wrong with ME! I just... I don't... this is MY house and I make the rules!

**SEMMI**  
*(defensive)*  
Nothing is wrong with ME! I just... I don't... this is MY house and I make the rules!

**MARIA**  
*(crying, humiliated)*  
I'm sorry I said anything. I'm sorry—

**SEMMI**  
*(to Maria)*  
Come with me.

He grabs her arm—not violent, but firm.

**MARIA**  
*(pulling away)*  
No! I don't want to!

**SEMMI**  
I'm not asking!

**RITA**  
*(stepping forward)*  
She's thirteen years old! She just had to tell you something incredibly personal and painful, and you're treating her like—

**SEMMI**  
Like WHAT? Like she's DIFFERENT? Well she IS different! She said so herself!

He drags her toward a door near the kitchen—a closet or small room.

**GOOMO** moves to intervene.

**GOOMO**  
Let her go!

**SEMMI**  
*(turning, wild-eyed)*  
Everyone BACK OFF!

He opens the door, pushes **MARIA** inside. She stumbles.

---

### INT. CLOSET/SMALL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

**MARIA** catches herself, looking around. The room is small but oddly well-decorated—vintage wallpaper, a small wooden chair, soft lighting from a lamp.

**MARIA**  
*(surprised, to herself)*  
Oh... this is actually kind of nice—

Then she smells it. Her face contorts.

**MARIA** *(CONT'D)*  
What is that smell?

She turns and sees **PADDY**, the dog, lying in the corner. Next to him: a pile of dog feces.

**MARIA** *(CONT'D)*  
*(disgusted)*  
Oh no... no no no...

The smell hits her fully. She covers her nose.

**MARIA** *(CONT'D)*  
*(to Paddy)*  
Hey! Hey, dog! You need to move! Go on! Shoo!

She waves her arms at **PADDY**. The dog doesn't move. Just stares at her.

**MARIA** *(CONT'D)*  
Please! I need to sit somewhere! You have to move!

She tries to shoo him again, more frantically. **PADDY** doesn't budge. Just lays there, exhausted from his earlier confrontation with Semmi.

**MARIA** *(CONT'D)*  
*(desperate)*  
Come on! Please! I can't... I can't be near that!

She looks around the small room. There's nowhere else to go. The chair is too close to the dog. The floor is dirty. The smell is overwhelming.

**MARIA** breaks down crying.

**MARIA** *(CONT'D)*  
*(sobbing)*  
Let me out! Please!

She runs to the door, banging on it.

**MARIA** *(CONT'D)*  
*(through tears)*  
I'm sorry! I'm sorry I said anything! Please let me out!

She pounds on the door desperately.

---

### INT. SEMMI'S LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

**SEMMI** stands on the other side of the door, listening to **MARIA**'s muffled cries and pounding.

**SEMMI**  
*(to the group)*  
She needs time to think. We all need time to think.

**BELLO**  
*(advancing)*  
Open that door. RIGHT NOW.

**SEMMI**  
*(pulling out his PHONE)*  
Or what? You'll attack me? I'll call the police. Say you broke into my house. Threatened me. Who do you think they'll believe? The ranger who works with Officer James? Or a bunch of people who forced their way in?

**NATALIE**  
You INVITED us!

**SEMMI**  
Prove it.

He smirks.

From the closet: **MARIA** banging on the door, crying.

**MARIA** *(muffled)*  
There's a dog in here! And it smells so bad! Please let me out!

**SEMMI**  
*(casually)*  
Oh, right. Paddy's in there. He sometimes stays in that room when I need him contained. He might have made a mess. She'll be fine.

**RITA**  
*(horrified)*  
You locked a thirteen-year-old in a room with dog feces?!

**SEMMI**  
It's not FECES, it's just... a smell. Dramatic much?

**GOOMO**  
That's it. I'm calling the cops.

He pulls out his phone.

**SEMMI**  
*(calmly)*  
No signal. I have a jammer. For privacy.

**GOOMO** looks at his phone. No bars.

**GOOMO**  
*(disbelieving)*  
You have a JAMMER?

**SEMMI**  
Security. I value my privacy.

**BELLO**  
You're insane.

**SEMMI**  
*(shrugging)*  
I'm prepared.

From the closet, **MARIA** is crying now, pounding weakly.

**MARIA** *(muffled)*  
Please... please let me out...

**MAY** is sobbing in the high chair, unable to get out on her own.

**SEMMI** looks around at everyone.

**SEMMI**  
*(spreads arms)*  
THIS is the real me. This is who I've always been. Control. Order. Rules. And at work, I have to HIDE it. Pretend I'm relaxed. Easygoing. "Fun Semmi who flies helicopters." But here? Here I don't have to pretend.

**MR. HOLT**  
*(quietly)*  
Does Officer James know? About any of this?

**SEMMI**  
*(laughing)*  
James? James doesn't know ANYTHING about me. He thinks I'm his buddy. His reliable partner. He has no idea who he's been working with for three years.

**NATALIE**  
Three years? I thought you said eight?

**SEMMI**  
*(realizing his slip)*  
I've lived HERE eight years. I've worked with James for three. Math, Natalie.

**BELLO**  
What did you do before that?

**SEMMI**  
*(defensive)*  
That's not relevant.

**GOOMO**  
It is if you're hiding something.

**SEMMI**  
I'm not hiding ANYTHING! I'm finally SHOWING everything!

He's spiraling, pacing faster.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
You all wanted to see the real me? Well HERE I AM! This is WHO I AM! And you know what? I'm DONE apologizing for it! I'm done pretending to be someone I'm not just to make people comfortable!

**RITA**  
*(carefully)*  
Semmi... I think you need help. Professional help.

**SEMMI**  
*(stopping)*  
Help? You think I need HELP? I'm the most organized person you'll ever meet! I have systems! Structure! Purpose!

**MR. HOLT**  
You also have a teenager locked in a closet with dog waste.

**SEMMI** looks at the closet door. For a moment, something like doubt crosses his face.

**SEMMI**  
*(quieter)*  
She... she was disrespectful. She needed to learn.

**BELLO**  
Learn what? To be afraid of you?

**SEMMI**  
To RESPECT me!

He slams his hand on the kitchen counter.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
EVERYONE needs to respect me! I've EARNED respect! I save lives! I fly helicopters! I'm GOOD at what I do! And everyone treats me like I'm just... just some weirdo with a radio collection!

**NATALIE**  
Nobody thinks that—

**SEMMI**  
YES THEY DO! I see the looks! At the station! When I talk about my hobbies! When I mention my routines! Everyone thinks I'm WEIRD!

**GOOMO**  
*(gently)*  
Maybe because this—all of this—IS weird, man. This isn't normal behavior.

**SEMMI** stares at him.

**SEMMI**  
Get out.

**GOOMO**  
What?

**SEMMI**  
Get out of my house. NOW.

**GOOMO**  
You said we couldn't leave.

**SEMMI**  
I changed my mind. You're not my friend. Friends don't call each other weird. GET. OUT.

He pulls out a KEY from his pocket, strides to the door, unlocks it, throws it open.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
LEAVE!

**GOOMO** doesn't move.

**GOOMO**  
Not without Maria. And May.

**SEMMI**  
*(quietly dangerous)*  
They stay.

**GOOMO**  
No.

**SEMMI**  
Then YOU stay too.

He slams the door shut. Locks it again. Pockets the key.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(to everyone)*  
New plan. Nobody leaves until I say so. You all came here to judge me. To see the "weird guy's weird house." Fine. Then you're going to SIT here and APPRECIATE what I've built. You're going to understand WHO I AM.

He gestures around at his collection.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
Every piece has a story. Every item has meaning. And you're going to sit here and LISTEN to every single story until you UNDERSTAND.

**BELLO**  
Semmi, this is kidnapping.

**SEMMI**  
*(laughing)*  
Kidnapping? You're my GUESTS! Guests stay for the whole visit!

He sits down on the mid-century couch, looking at them all.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
Let's start with the radio. 1963 Zenith Royal 500...

He begins talking, explaining its history in obsessive detail.

Nobody's listening. Everyone's looking at each other, trying to figure out how to escape.

**MARIA** has stopped banging on the door. Just quiet crying now.

**MAY** is still in the high chair, hiccupping with sobs.

The **DOCUMENTARY RADIO** still drones on.

The **SHOPPING CHANNEL** still plays.

And **SEMMI** talks and talks and talks, oblivious or uncaring that nobody's paying attention.

**FADE OUT.**
