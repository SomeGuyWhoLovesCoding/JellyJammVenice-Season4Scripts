# SEASON 4, EPISODE 2: "THE OPULENCE OF SEMMI"
## ACT ONE

---

**FADE IN:**

### EXT. SEMMI'S HOUSE - DAY

A modest two-story home in a quiet neighborhood. Snow beginning to dust the lawn. Two cars are parked in the driveway—we recognize them from previous episodes.

### INT. SEMMI'S LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

An open-concept space. The **LEFT SIDE** (15%) is a cramped **KITCHEN**—counters cluttered with precisely organized jars and containers. The **RIGHT SIDE** (85%) is the **LIVING ROOM**, spacious but filled with an unsettling mix of expensive vintage furniture and ordinary items.

A pristine **MID-CENTURY MODERN COUCH** (clearly expensive, teak arms, original upholstery) sits center. Across from it, a cheaper, worn loveseat.

On a **VINTAGE TEAK SIDE TABLE** sits an immaculate **ZENITH TRANSISTOR RADIO** from the 1960s—collector quality, worth thousands. It plays tinny **1960s DOCUMENTARY NARRATION** about industrial manufacturing. The monotonous voice drones on.

The room stretches back to END with two small **ARMCHAIRS** against a wall that **GRADIENTS** from white to **LIGHT GREY**. On one armchair sits a **GLITTERY SWEATER**, draped carefully like a museum piece.

**BELLO** (27, warm presence, casual clothes) sits on the mid-century couch next to **NATALIE** (late 20s, relaxed). **GOOMO** (21, lanky, easygoing) and **RITA** (22, bright-eyed) occupy the cheaper loveseat.

**MAY** (8, energetic, curious) sits cross-legged on the floor near the coffee table, looking around with wide eyes. **MARIA** (13, transgender girl, excited energy) bounces slightly on the edge of the loveseat next to Rita.

Everyone seems comfortable, genuinely enjoying themselves.

**MARIA**  
*(excited)*  
This place is SO cool! Look at that radio! Is it real?

**NATALIE**  
*(smiling)*  
I think everything here is real, sweetie.

**BELLO**  
*(to Goomo)*  
How long has that documentary been on?

**GOOMO**  
Since we got here. Twenty minutes? It's kind of relaxing, actually.

The **DOCUMENTARY VOICE** continues, discussing riveting techniques from 1963.

**RITA**  
*(admiringly)*  
Semmi really has great taste. This couch is gorgeous.

**MAY**  
*(looking around)*  
Can we explore? Are there more rooms?

**BELLO**  
*(gently)*  
Let's wait for Semmi to show us around, okay?

**NATALIE** stands up and walks toward the back of the room, eyeing the armchair with the glittery sweater.

**NATALIE**  
*(calling back)*  
Is anyone sitting here?

She picks up the sweater, examining it.

**NATALIE** *(CONT'D)*  
This is beautiful. Vintage?

She sets it aside and sits down in the armchair.

**SEMMI** (age unknown, wearing an expensive cashmere cardigan and slippers) emerges from the cramped **KITCHEN** area carrying a tray with **VINTAGE PORCELAIN CUPS**—clearly antiques, mismatched but each worth money.

His eyes immediately lock on the glittery sweater, now on the floor. He pauses, but maintains his smile.

**SEMMI**  
Coffee! I made coffee. Everyone needs coffee.

He sets the tray down on a **GLASS COFFEE TABLE** (modern, cheap, doesn't match the vintage couch) with exaggerated care, adjusting each cup perfectly.

**MARIA**  
*(bouncing up)*  
Can I have some? I love coffee!

**SEMMI**  
*(warm but firm)*  
Maybe hot chocolate for you, young lady. Coffee stunts growth.

**MARIA**  
*(playfully groaning)*  
I'm already growing!

Everyone chuckles. **SEMMI** seems pleased by the laughter.

**BELLO**  
Thanks for having us, Semmi. This is really nice.

**SEMMI**  
*(animated)*  
You know what I was listening to this morning? A documentary from 1967 about the phonograph industry. Absolutely fascinating. The way they pressed vinyl back then—the precision! The craftsmanship!

**NATALIE**  
*(genuinely interested)*  
That's the era you collect from, right? The sixties?

**SEMMI**  
*(excited)*  
YES! Finally, someone who understands! Not like today. Today everything's digital, soulless—

He suddenly stops mid-sentence, staring at the radio with reverence.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
Hold on. Hold on, this is the good part.

Everyone sits quietly as the **DOCUMENTARY VOICE** describes factory floor layouts. **SEMMI** nods along enthusiastically.

**MAY** whispers to **BELLO**.

**MAY**  
*(whispering)*  
Why does he like old stuff so much?

**BELLO**  
*(whispering back)*  
Some people just appreciate history.

**SEMMI**'s eyes drift to the glittery sweater on the floor. He walks over calmly and picks it up with both hands, like it's delicate.

**SEMMI**  
*(to Natalie, friendly)*  
This was my mother's. 1968. She wore it to every holiday party.

He drapes it back on the armchair exactly as it was before.

**NATALIE**  
*(apologetic)*  
Oh! I'm sorry, I didn't know—

**SEMMI**  
*(waving it off)*  
No, no! You couldn't have known. Just... everything here has a story. A place.

**MARIA**  
*(fascinated)*  
What's the story with that radio?

**SEMMI**  
*(lighting up)*  
1963 Zenith Royal 500! Transistor radio. Mint condition. My grandfather carried it to baseball games. Still works perfectly. They don't make them like this anymore.

**GOOMO**  
*(impressed)*  
That's really cool, man. You've got a great collection.

**SEMMI**  
*(proudly)*  
Eight years of collecting! Same routines. Same schedule. Consistency is important.

**RITA**  
*(warmly)*  
It shows. Everything's so... curated.

**SEMMI** walks back to the kitchen area, picking up a **CORDLESS PHONE** (old model, but high-end from its era).

**BELLO**  
Who are you calling?

**SEMMI**  
*(casually)*  
Oh, just checking in with some people. I like to stay connected. Keep my network active.

He dials, leaning against the kitchen counter.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(into phone)*  
Hello? Yes, hi, it's Semmi. From 47 Oakwood. I'm calling about the estate sale—  
*(pause)*  
No, the OTHER estate sale—  
*(pause)*  
Never mind. I'll call back.

He hangs up and immediately starts dialing again.

**MAY**  
*(curious)*  
Do you call a lot of people?

**SEMMI**  
*(not looking up)*  
Networking! Very important in the antique world. You have to know who's selling what, when.

**MARIA** stands up and walks toward the kitchen area.

**MARIA**  
*(excitedly)*  
Can I see what you have in there? I love organized kitchens!

**MINA** (28, practical) emerges from the kitchen area where she's been looking around.

**MINA**  
*(amused)*  
Maria, there are fifteen different types of mustard in here. FIFTEEN.

**MARIA**  
*(delighted)*  
That's AMAZING!

**SEMMI**  
*(proudly, into phone)*  
—yes, I'll call you back.

He hangs up and turns to them.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
Different purposes! Different sandwiches. Organization is key. Every mustard has its place.

**GOOMO**  
*(laughing)*  
You're serious about your condiments.

**SEMMI**  
*(seriously)*  
I'm serious about EVERYTHING. Quality matters.

The **DOCUMENTARY RADIO** continues its monotonous narration. No one seems bothered by it.

**NATALIE**  
*(from the armchair)*  
Semmi, what's upstairs? May was asking if there are more rooms to see.

**SEMMI**  
*(animated)*  
Eight rooms! Well, seven and a half. The half-room is more of a storage situation for my newspaper archives. Very organized. Everything labeled, dated, cross-referenced.

**MAY**  
*(excited)*  
Can we see?

**SEMMI**  
After lunch! I'll give everyone the grand tour. But first—sandwiches!

**MARIA**  
*(bouncing)*  
Yes! I'm starving!

A **KNOCK** at the front door.

**MR. HOLT** (late 40s, distinguished, warm demeanor) stands outside.

**SEMMI**'s face lights up. He rushes to the door.

**SEMMI**  
*(opening door)*  
Mr. Holt! Perfect timing! Come in, come in!

**MR. HOLT**  
*(entering, pleasantly surprised)*  
I hope I'm not intruding. I heard the whole group was here and thought—

**SEMMI**  
*(enthusiastically)*  
Not at all! Everyone's welcome! The more the merrier!

He practically ushers **MR. HOLT** toward the loveseat. **GOOMO** and **RITA** squeeze over to make room.

**MR. HOLT** sits down, immediately noticing the expensive mid-century furniture.

**MR. HOLT**  
*(impressed)*  
Semmi, this place is beautiful. I had no idea you were a collector.

**SEMMI**  
*(glowing with pride)*  
Most people don't! At work, it's all helicopters and rescue operations. But this—THIS is who I really am.

**BELLO**  
We were just saying how different it is seeing you here. In a good way!

**SEMMI**  
*(meaningfully)*  
Exactly. At the station, I'm Semmi the ranger. Here? I'm just... me. The REAL me.

Everyone nods appreciatively.

**MARIA**  
*(to Mr. Holt)*  
Did you see the radio? It's from 1963!

**MR. HOLT**  
*(charmed)*  
I did! Beautiful piece.

**SEMMI**  
*(to the group)*  
See? THIS is what I wanted. All of us together. In MY space. Where I can share what I love.

The **DOCUMENTARY RADIO** shifts to a new segment—something about assembly line innovations.

**MAY**  
*(to Semmi)*  
Do you have a dog? I heard barking earlier.

**SEMMI**  
*(warmly)*  
Paddy! Yes! He's upstairs, probably napping. He gets excited when people visit. I'll introduce you all later.

**MARIA**  
*(excited)*  
I love dogs!

**SEMMI**  
*(moving to kitchen)*  
Alright! Sandwich time! Everyone stay put. I have a SYSTEM.

He disappears into the cramped kitchen area. From the living room, they can see and hear everything—him pulling out bread, arranging ingredients in a specific order, muttering happily to himself.

**NATALIE**  
*(to Bello)*  
This is really nice. I'm glad we came.

**BELLO**  
*(agreeing)*  
Yeah. It's good to see him outside of work. He seems... happier.

**GOOMO**  
*(to Rita)*  
He really loves this stuff, huh?

**RITA**  
*(smiling)*  
It's sweet. Everyone needs their hobbies.

**MR. HOLT**  
*(to Mina)*  
Have you been here before?

**MINA**  
First time. It's... definitely unique.

She says it fondly, not critically.

In the kitchen, **SEMMI** is precisely cutting sandwiches, arranging them on a **VINTAGE SERVING PLATTER** (1950s, expensive, ornate).

**SEMMI**  
*(calling out cheerfully)*  
I'm using three different mustards! German, Dijon, and whole grain! Each sandwich is paired specifically!

**MAY**  
*(delighted)*  
He's like a chef!

**MARIA**  
*(to May)*  
This is the best house visit ever.

A **BARK** from upstairs—not frantic, just a dog making noise.

**SEMMI**  
*(from kitchen, unbothered)*  
That's Paddy. He knows we're having fun without him.

Everyone laughs.

**SEMMI** returns with the tray of sandwiches—each one cut into precise triangles, arranged in a perfect spiral pattern on the vintage platter.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(presenting proudly)*  
Voilà! This platter is from 1954. My grandmother's. Worth more than most cars, but what good is beautiful china if you never use it?

He sets it carefully on the cheap glass coffee table—the juxtaposition of expensive and ordinary.

**BELLO**  
*(impressed)*  
Semmi, this is incredible. You didn't have to go to all this trouble.

**SEMMI**  
*(sitting on the mid-century couch)*  
No trouble! This is what I do. Precision. Care. Attention to detail.

Everyone reaches for sandwiches, being careful with the valuable platter.

**MAY** takes a bite.

**MAY**  
*(mouth full)*  
This is really good!

**MARIA**  
*(tasting hers)*  
What mustard is this?

**SEMMI**  
*(pleased)*  
Whole grain! I knew you'd like that one. I'm very good at reading people.

He watches everyone eat with satisfaction.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(contentedly)*  
This is perfect. All of you here. Appreciating what I've built. Understanding me.

**MR. HOLT**  
*(raising his sandwich)*  
To Semmi and his hospitality.

**EVERYONE**  
*(cheerfully)*  
To Semmi!

**SEMMI** beams.

The **DOCUMENTARY RADIO** drones on. The glittery sweater sits perfectly on the armchair. The gradient grey wall stretches behind them.

Everything feels warm and comfortable.

### INT. SEMMI'S LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - LATER

About fifteen minutes have passed. Everyone has finished eating. Plates are cleared.

**SEMMI** is on the phone again in the kitchen area, pacing, gesturing animatedly.

**BELLO** and **NATALIE** are talking on the couch. **BELLO**'s getting animated about something—relationship troubles.

**BELLO**  
—and I just don't understand why she'd say that, you know? After everything I did? Everything I—

**SEMMI**  
*(covering phone receiver, friendly but firm)*  
Bello! Hey! Could you keep it down just a touch? I'm trying to close a deal on a 1965 record player.

**BELLO**  
*(immediately apologetic)*  
Oh! Sorry, man.

**SEMMI**  
*(into phone, warmly)*  
No, not you. My friend. Very passionate guy. Great energy.  
*(pause)*  
Yes, I'll call you back in five.

He hangs up and walks into the living room area with a smile.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(to Bello and Natalie)*  
Why don't you two continue in the dining room? More comfortable. Better acoustics. Really, you'll prefer it.

**NATALIE**  
*(standing)*  
That's sweet of you. Come on, Bello.

**BELLO**  
*(grateful)*  
Thanks, Semmi.

They head to the dining room.

**SEMMI**  
*(to himself, satisfied)*  
Perfect. Problem solved.

**MAY** is sitting on the floor, playing with a small vintage toy car she found on a shelf.

**MAY**  
*(to Semmi)*  
Can I play with this?

**SEMMI**  
*(warmly)*  
Of course! That's a 1967 Matchbox. Very rare, but toys are meant to be played with. My philosophy.

**MAY**  
*(delighted)*  
Cool!

A **BARK** from upstairs. Then another.

**MARIA**  
*(looking up)*  
Can we meet Paddy now? Please?

**SEMMI**  
*(checking his watch)*  
Soon! He needs his afternoon rest. Very important for dogs to have routines.

**MARIA**  
*(accepting this)*  
Okay!

**GOOMO**  
*(to Semmi)*  
You want any help cleaning up?

**SEMMI**  
*(appreciatively)*  
No, no. You're guests! Just relax. Enjoy yourselves.

He moves back to the kitchen, carefully washing the vintage platter by hand.

**RITA**  
*(to Goomo, quietly)*  
He's really particular about his things.

**GOOMO**  
*(nodding)*  
But in a good way. He cares about what he owns.

**MR. HOLT** pulls out a newspaper from his bag.

**MR. HOLT**  
Semmi, do you mind if I read?

**SEMMI**  
*(from kitchen, excited)*  
You read physical newspapers? Mr. Holt, you're a man after my own heart! Please!

**MR. HOLT** settles in, reading.

**MINA** sits on the floor near May, watching her play.

**MINA**  
*(to May)*  
Having fun?

**MAY**  
*(nodding enthusiastically)*  
This is the best day!

**MARIA** stands up and stretches.

**MARIA**  
*(to Semmi)*  
Can I look around a little? Not touch anything! Just look?

**SEMMI**  
*(turning, considering)*  
Actually... why don't you wait? I'll give everyone the official tour after I make more coffee. Everything's better with context. With stories.

**MARIA**  
*(excited)*  
Okay! I can wait!

She sits back down, practically vibrating with anticipation.

**SEMMI** finishes with the platter, drying it meticulously before placing it on a high shelf.

**SEMMI**  
*(calling out)*  
Who wants more coffee? Or hot chocolate for the kids?

**MULTIPLE VOICES**  
Yes! / Sure! / I'll take some!

**SEMMI**  
*(happily)*  
Coming right up!

He pulls out the antique porcelain cups again, humming tunelessly as he works.

The **DOCUMENTARY RADIO** shifts to a new topic—textile manufacturing from 1965.

**SEMMI**  
*(listening)*  
Oh! This is a good one!

He adjusts the volume slightly higher.

No one objects. They're all comfortable, content.

**NATALIE** and **BELLO**'s voices can be heard from the dining room—talking, laughing.

**MAY** drives the vintage toy car across the floor making quiet engine noises.

**MARIA** watches Semmi work in the kitchen, fascinated by his precision.

**GOOMO** and **RITA** chat quietly on the loveseat.

**MR. HOLT** reads his newspaper.

**MINA** leans back, relaxed.

**SEMMI** returns with fresh coffee and two mugs of hot chocolate for May and Maria.

**SEMMI**  
*(distributing drinks)*  
There we go. Perfect.

He sits back on the mid-century couch, looking around at everyone.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(warmly)*  
You know, I've wanted this for so long. To share my space with people who appreciate it. Who see what I see.

**RITA**  
*(sincerely)*  
We really do appreciate it, Semmi.

**GOOMO**  
*(nodding)*  
Yeah, man. This is great.

**MARIA**  
*(enthusiastically)*  
Best house ever!

**SEMMI**  
*(touched)*  
You mean that?

**MARIA**  
*(nodding vigorously)*  
Yes! Can we come back?

**SEMMI**  
*(delighted)*  
Anytime! All of you. Anytime.

He takes a sip of his coffee, watching them all with satisfaction.

The **DOCUMENTARY RADIO** continues. The gradient grey wall looms in the background. The glittery sweater remains perfectly draped.

Everything is comfortable.

Everything is fine.

Close on **SEMMI**'s face—content, almost peaceful.

Then his eyes drift to the TV.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(suddenly)*  
Oh! We should have some background entertainment. Something lighter.

He stands and walks to the TV, turning it on.

It's tuned to a **NEWS** channel. Political coverage.

His face changes—just slightly. A tightening around the eyes.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(quietly)*  
No.

He changes the channel. Another news program.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(voice flat)*  
No.

He changes it again. Another news program.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(clicking faster)*  
Why is everything—

**GOOMO**  
*(standing, friendly)*  
Semmi, maybe just leave it off? We're good without TV.

**SEMMI**  
*(not listening, clicking through channels)*  
There has to be something else. Something better.

Click. Click. Click. News, news, news.

He lands on a **SHOPPING CHANNEL**. A host enthusiastically demonstrating kitchen gadgets.

**SEMMI**'s face relaxes immediately.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(exhaling)*  
There. Perfect. Much better.

He sets the remote down gently and turns back to everyone with his warm smile restored.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
Sorry. I just prefer not to have news on. Too much negativity. This is a positive space.

**EVERYONE**  
*(understanding)*  
Makes sense. / That's fair. / I get that.

**SEMMI**  
*(sitting back down)*  
Thank you for understanding. That's what friends do. They understand.

The **DOCUMENTARY RADIO** plays. The shopping channel plays. The two audio sources clash slightly but no one mentions it.

**SEMMI** looks content.

**MARIA** sips her hot chocolate, happy.

**MAY** plays with the vintage car.

Everything is fine.

The **DOCUMENTARY VOICE** drones on about manufacturing quotas from 1964.

The gradient grey wall stretches behind them.

The glittery sweater sits untouched.

**FADE OUT.**
