## ACT TWO

### INT. SEMMI'S LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

**SEMMI** rises from the mid-century couch with practiced grace.

**SEMMI**  
Alright. Tour time.

**MARIA**  
*(bouncing up)*  
Finally! I've been waiting.

**MAY**  
Can we see Paddy?

**SEMMI**  
Upstairs first. Work our way down. Follow me.

**BELLO**  
Lead on.

The group assembles. **BELLO** and **NATALIE** emerge from the dining room. **SEMMI** heads for the stairs, everyone trailing behind.

The **DOCUMENTARY RADIO** hums beneath the conversation.

**GOOMO**  
How long did it take to collect all this?

**SEMMI**  
Eight years. Every piece sourced. Every purchase documented.

**RITA**  
That's commitment.

**SEMMI**  
It's curation. There's a difference.

---

### INT. SEMMI'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Narrow. Vintage wallpaper. Doors on both sides.

**SEMMI** gestures to the first door.

**SEMMI**  
Guest room. Pure 1950s. Nothing reproduction.

He opens it. Perfectly made bed. Vintage quilt. Antique dresser. Museum-quality.

**RITA**  
Beautiful.

**NATALIE**  
Do you have guests often?

**SEMMI**  
Rarely. I value my space. But it's ready. Always ready.

**MARIA**  
Can I look inside?

**SEMMI**  
Look. Don't touch.

**MARIA** steps in briefly, eyes wide, then returns.

**SEMMI**  
*(closing the door)*  
Preservation. That's the goal.

Next door.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
Bathroom. 1960s tile. Pink and grey.

**MINA** peers in.

**MINA**  
Pristine condition.

**SEMMI**  
Maintenance schedule. Tuesday deep clean. Friday inspection. Sunday repairs.

**MR. HOLT**  
Disciplined.

**SEMMI**  
It's the only way things don't fall apart.

He pauses at the third door. Hand on the knob.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
Archive room.

**BELLO**  
Archive?

**SEMMI**  
Research. You'll see.

Opens it.

---

### INT. ARCHIVE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Floor to ceiling newspaper clippings. Plastic sleeves. Labels. Dates.

All about **helicopter accidents**.

Silence.

**NATALIE**  
These are all...

**SEMMI**  
Helicopter accidents. Crashes. Failures. Every variable documented.

**BELLO**  
*(stepping closer)*  
Thorough.

**GOOMO**  
How long?

**SEMMI**  
Eight years. Cross-referenced by date, location, cause. Weather. Pilot experience. Mechanical failure.

**RITA**  
This must have taken considerable time.

**SEMMI**  
Knowledge requires time. Safety requires understanding. Most people wing it. I don't.

**MARIA** reads a headline. Her smile fades.

**MARIA**  
All these people died.

**SEMMI**  
Every accident is a lesson. Every death means something.

**MR. HOLT**  
Does Officer James know about this?

**SEMMI**  
*(edge in his voice)*  
Why would he? This is my research. Private study.

**MR. HOLT**  
I thought given your partnership—

**SEMMI**  
He knows I'm thorough. That's enough.

Beat.

**MAY**  
Can we see Paddy now?

**SEMMI**  
*(moving to the door)*  
More to see first.

He ushers them out. Closes the door. Ensures it's shut completely.

---

### INT. SEMMI'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Down the hall. **BARKING** from behind a door.

**PADDY** scratching inside.

**MAY**  
That's Paddy!

**SEMMI**  
He's resting.

**MARIA**  
He sounds awake.

**BARKING** intensifies. **SCRATCHING**.

**SEMMI**  
Overstimulation. He gets chaotic. I prefer controlled environments.

**MINA**  
The kids really want to meet him.

**SEMMI**  
*(firm)*  
He's fine where he is.

The warmth evaporates.

**GOOMO**  
No worries. Later works.

**SEMMI** softens slightly.

**SEMMI**  
Schedule. Feeding, play, rest. Breaking it causes behavioral issues.

**GOOMO**  
Your house, your rules.

**SEMMI**  
Exactly.

**BARKING** continues behind them. **MAY** looks back, concerned.

**SEMMI** opens another door.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
My bedroom. 1962 complete set. Original hardware.

Immaculate. Hospital corners. Perfect symmetry.

**NATALIE**  
Very organized.

**SEMMI**  
Chaos breeds anxiety. Order breeds clarity.

**MINA** steps back, bumps a small hallway table. A **VINTAGE VASE** rocks.

**SEMMI** lunges. Catches it.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(sharp)*  
1959 Murano glass. Irreplaceable.

**MINA**  
*(startled)*  
Sorry—I didn't see—

**SEMMI**  
Awareness. Everything here has value.

**MINA**  
I understand.

**SEMMI** repositions the vase. Measures the distance from the table edge with his fingers.

**SEMMI**  
*(not looking at her)*  
Mindfulness. Please.

**BELLO**  
We're being careful.

The group exchanges glances. Ease replaced by tension.

**BELLO** *(CONT'D)*  
Maybe we should head back downstairs?

**SEMMI**  
One more room. You came to see everything.

**RITA**  
We don't want to intrude—

**SEMMI**  
You're not. I want you to see.

Last door. Opens it.

---

### INT. STORAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Shelves. Labeled boxes. File cabinets. Binders. Obsessive precision.

**SEMMI**  
Documentation. Receipts. Provenance. Authentication certificates. Eight years of records.

**NATALIE**  
Meticulous.

**SEMMI**  
Otherwise it's chaos. I need to know what I have. Where it came from. What it's worth.

**MR. HOLT**  
You catalog everything?

**SEMMI**  
Everything. Purchase date. Source. Price. Current value. Condition notes.

**GOOMO**  
That's serious record-keeping.

**SEMMI**  
Necessary record-keeping.

**MARIA** notices a box: "PERSONAL - DO NOT OPEN."

**MARIA**  
What's in that one?

**SEMMI**  
*(immediate)*  
Private.

**MARIA**  
Oh.

**SEMMI**  
Some things aren't for display.

Conversation ends.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
Tour complete. Downstairs. I'll make lunch.

**BELLO**  
Really, you don't have to—

**SEMMI**  
It's not trouble.

He ushers them out. Turns off the light. Checks the lock twice.

---

### INT. SEMMI'S LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Back in the main space. **DOCUMENTARY RADIO** discussing Arctic expeditions. **SHOPPING CHANNEL** demonstrating kitchen gadgets.

**SEMMI** goes straight to the kitchen. Pulls ingredients.

**SEMMI**  
Fresh pasta. Flour, eggs, salt. Technique matters.

**BELLO**  
*(sitting)*  
You don't have to cook—

**SEMMI**  
I want to. You're my guests. This is what people do. Share meals. Spend time.

**RITA**  
That's kind.

**SEMMI**  
It's what you do.

**GOOMO**  
*(to Rita, quietly)*  
He seems tense.

**RITA**  
*(whispering)*  
I noticed.

**MR. HOLT** sits in the armchair. Forgets about the glittery sweater. Shifts. Feels it. Pulls it out.

**MR. HOLT**  
Sorry—

Starts to drape it casually.

**SEMMI**  
*(from kitchen, not turning)*  
Not like that.

Everyone turns.

**SEMMI** comes over. Takes the sweater. Drapes it precisely—exact folds over the left arm.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
My mother's sweater. Always like this. Left arm. These folds.

**MR. HOLT**  
Of course. My apologies.

**SEMMI** stares at it. Hand resting on the fabric. Then returns to the kitchen without a word.

**SEMMI**  
Pasta.

His movements change. Cabinets slam. Pots clang.

**NATALIE**  
*(to Bello, quietly)*  
We should leave soon.

**BELLO**  
*(nodding)*  
After lunch. We'll make an excuse.

**MAY** and **MARIA** sit with the toy car. Rolling it quietly between them.

**MARIA**  
*(to May, whisper)*  
He's acting weird.

**MAY**  
*(whisper)*  
I want to go home.

**MARIA**  
Me too.

**MINA** approaches the kitchen.

**MINA**  
Can I help? I make decent pasta.

**SEMMI**  
*(not looking)*  
I have a system.

**MINA**  
Maybe set the table?

**SEMMI**  
Already set.

**MINA** glances at the dining room. It's not.

**MINA**  
Actually—

Reaches for a pot.

**SEMMI**  
*(grabs her wrist)*  
Don't.

**MINA** freezes. Everyone looks.

**SEMMI** releases her. Steps back.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
That pot is positioned correctly. Move it, everything collapses. Understand?

**MINA**  
*(backing away)*  
Yes.

**SEMMI**  
Good.

She returns to the living room. Rubs her wrist.

**GOOMO** stands.

**GOOMO**  
Semmi, we're pretty full from earlier. Maybe we should head out—

**SEMMI**  
*(turning)*  
No. I'm making lunch. Leaving before lunch is rude.

**GOOMO**  
We're not trying to be rude—

**SEMMI**  
I invited you. I want you here.

**GOOMO**  
*(sitting)*  
Okay. We'll stay.

**SEMMI**  
Good. Everyone's having a nice time. Right?

Silence.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(harder)*  
Right?

**EVERYONE**  
*(uncomfortable)*  
Yes. / Sure.

**SEMMI**  
See?

Turns back to the stove. Water boils. Pot clangs.

Tense silence. **DOCUMENTARY RADIO** discusses failed expeditions. **SHOPPING CHANNEL** feels invasive now.

**BELLO** checks his phone discreetly.

**SEMMI**  
*(facing the stove)*  
No phones. House rule.

**BELLO**  
*(pockets it)*  
Just checking the time.

**SEMMI**  
Time doesn't matter. We're just being together.

**MARIA** whispers to **RITA**.

**MARIA**  
I don't like this anymore.

**RITA**  
*(arm around her)*  
We'll leave after lunch.

**SEMMI**  
*(not turning)*  
What are you whispering about?

**RITA**  
*(startled)*  
Just talking to Maria.

**SEMMI**  
*(turning)*  
Talk louder. No secrets among friends.

**RITA**  
We weren't—

**SEMMI**  
*(smile)*  
Talk louder. So everyone can participate.

Turns back. Pulls out cutting board and knife.

**MINA** goes to the refrigerator. Opens it. Takes out a juice box.

**SEMMI** sees it. **STABS** the knife into the cutting board. Right next to the box.

**MINA** jumps. Drops it.

**SEMMI**  
I didn't say you could take that.

**MINA**  
*(angry)*  
What the hell? You could've hurt me.

**SEMMI**  
But I didn't. Excellent aim. You're overreacting.

**MINA**  
You just stabbed a knife inches from my hand!

**SEMMI**  
In my kitchen. On my cutting board. That's not a crime.

**MARIA** stands.

**MARIA**  
That wasn't nice. You scared Mina.

**MAY**  
*(standing)*  
You shouldn't do that.

**SEMMI**  
*(turns to them)*  
She was taking without asking. My house. My kitchen. My food.

**MARIA**  
Friends share.

**SEMMI**  
Friends ask first. Friends respect boundaries. Friends follow house rules.

**BELLO**  
*(standing)*  
Semmi, maybe we should—

**MINA**  
*(cutting him off)*  
You're crazy.

**SEMMI**  
*(quiet)*  
What did you call me?

**MINA**  
Crazy. The clippings, the schedules, the reactions—it's not normal.

**SEMMI**  
*(low voice)*  
Not normal? I'm organized. I have systems. That's the opposite of crazy.

**MINA**  
It's obsessive. Controlling.

**MARIA**  
Stop yelling!

**MAY** starts crying.

**BELLO** moves toward the children. Positions himself between them and the kitchen.

**BELLO**  
That's enough. We're leaving.

**SEMMI**  
*(blocks the door)*  
No. You're staying for lunch.

**BELLO**  
The kids are upset.

**SEMMI**  
They're fine. Sit down.

**GOOMO**  
*(standing)*  
Let's calm down—

**SEMMI**  
I am calm.

His hands tremble.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(to Mina)*  
Apologize.

**MINA**  
What?

**SEMMI**  
Apologize for calling me crazy. For taking my food. Apologize.

**MINA**  
*(defiant)*  
No.

**SEMMI**'s jaw clenches.

**SEMMI**  
Then leave.

**MINA**  
Fine.

Grabs her bag. Heads for the door.

**BELLO**  
Mina, wait—

**MINA**  
*(opening door)*  
I'm done.

Walks out. Door slams. Echo through the house.

**SEMMI** stands motionless. Staring at the closed door. Then turns to the stove. Stirs water that isn't boiling.

**SEMMI**  
More for everyone else.

**NATALIE**  
*(to Bello, quiet)*  
We need to leave. Now.

**BELLO**  
Semmi, we're heading out. Thank you, but—

**SEMMI**  
*(not turning)*  
No.

**BELLO**  
What?

**SEMMI**  
*(turns, wooden spoon in hand)*  
I said no. You came to see me. The real me. Now you want to leave because I have standards? Because I expect respect?

**RITA**  
*(standing, pulls Maria close)*  
We're not being disrespectful—

**SEMMI**  
*(interrupts)*  
You're like everyone else. Visit, pretend to care, then leave when things aren't perfect. Not this time.

**MR. HOLT**  
*(standing)*  
I have obligations this afternoon—

**SEMMI**  
*(voice rises)*  
Sit down.

Command, not request.

**MR. HOLT** slowly sits. Hands raised slightly.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
Everyone. Sit. We're eating lunch like civilized people. Then—if you still want to leave—we'll discuss it.

**GOOMO**  
Semmi, this isn't—

**SEMMI**  
*(points the spoon)*  
I'm not your buddy. At work, maybe. Here? I'm the host. You're guests. Guests follow rules. Sit.

One by one, they sit.

**MAY** cries softly. **MARIA** holds her hand, frightened. **RITA** pulls both girls close.

**SEMMI** turns to the stove. Drains barely-cooked pasta. Plates it with meticulous care. Each portion measured. Each plate positioned precisely.

**DOCUMENTARY RADIO** discusses men lost at sea.

**SHOPPING CHANNEL** maintains relentless enthusiasm.

Nobody speaks.

Only sounds: **SEMMI**'s movements. **MAY**'s crying. **PADDY** barking upstairs.

**FADE OUT.**
