# SEASON 4, EPISODE 2: "THE OPULENCE OF SEMMI"
## ACT TWO

---

### INT. SEMMI'S LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

The atmosphere is still comfortable, but there's a subtle shift in the air.

**SEMMI** stands up from the mid-century couch, clapping his hands together.

**SEMMI**  
Alright! Who's ready for the grand tour?

**MARIA**  
*(jumping up)*  
ME! I've been waiting!

**MAY**  
*(standing)*  
Can we see Paddy too?

**SEMMI**  
*(warmly)*  
Of course! We'll start upstairs, work our way down. Everyone, follow me!

The group stands—**BELLO** and **NATALIE** emerge from the dining room. Everyone gathers.

**SEMMI** leads them toward the stairs, the **DOCUMENTARY RADIO** still playing in the background.

---

### INT. SEMMI'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The hallway is narrow, wallpapered with a vintage pattern. Several doors line both sides.

**SEMMI** gestures to the first door.

**SEMMI**  
This is the guest room. 1950s furnishings. All original pieces.

He opens the door briefly—a glimpse of a perfectly made bed with a vintage quilt, antique dresser, everything pristine.

**RITA**  
*(impressed)*  
It's like a time capsule.

**SEMMI**  
*(proudly)*  
That's exactly what I'm going for. Preservation. History.

He moves to the next door.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
Bathroom. Second door, as I mentioned. 1960s tile work. Pink and grey. Very popular at the time.

**MINA** peeks in.

**MINA**  
The tile is in perfect condition.

**SEMMI**  
I maintain everything. Routine maintenance. Schedules. Lists.

He moves to the third door. Pauses.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
And this... this is my archive room.

He opens the door.

---

### INT. ARCHIVE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The walls are **COVERED** with newspaper clippings—floor to ceiling. All organized in clear plastic sleeves, labeled, dated. 

The subject: **Helicopter accidents. Crashes. Malfunctions. Deaths.**

The group falls silent, staring.

**NATALIE**  
*(quietly)*  
Semmi... this is all about helicopter accidents?

**SEMMI**  
*(matter-of-fact)*  
Research. I need to know what can go wrong. Every failure point. Every human error. That's how you stay safe. That's how you survive.

**BELLO**  
*(uncomfortable)*  
That's... thorough.

**GOOMO**  
How long have you been collecting these?

**SEMMI**  
Eight years. Same amount of time I've lived here. Every accident, every incident. Cross-referenced by date, location, cause of failure.

**MARIA** steps closer, reading some of the headlines. Her excitement dims slightly.

**MARIA**  
*(quietly)*  
These are really sad.

**SEMMI**  
*(turning to her)*  
They're educational. We learn from tragedy. That's what separates the professionals from the amateurs.

**MR. HOLT**  
*(carefully)*  
Does Officer James know about... this?

**SEMMI**  
*(defensive)*  
Why would he need to know? This is my private research. My home. My business.

An awkward beat.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(forcing brightness back)*  
Anyway! Let's continue. There's more to see!

He ushers them out, closing the door firmly behind them.

---

### INT. SEMMI'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

They move down the hall. **BARKING** comes from behind one of the doors—louder now, more insistent.

**PADDY** scratches at the door from the inside.

**MAY**  
That's Paddy! Can we meet him now?

**SEMMI**  
*(hesitating)*  
He's... still resting. Better to let him be.

**MARIA**  
But he sounds awake. He sounds like he wants out.

The **BARKING** continues. **SCRATCHING** intensifies.

**SEMMI**  
*(more firmly)*  
He's FINE. He gets excited. If we let him out now, he'll be too energetic. Too chaotic. I prefer calm. Order.

**MINA**  
*(gently)*  
Semmi, maybe just for a minute? The kids really want to—

**SEMMI**  
*(snapping)*  
I said he's FINE!

Everyone freezes. That was the first real edge in his voice.

**SEMMI** catches himself, forces a smile.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(softer)*  
Sorry. I just... I have a schedule for him. Feeding times, play times, rest times. Breaking the schedule causes problems. You understand.

**GOOMO**  
*(nodding slowly)*  
Sure, man. Your house, your rules.

**SEMMI**  
*(grateful)*  
Exactly. Thank you, Goomo. You get it.

The **BARKING** continues behind them as they move down the hallway.

**SEMMI** opens another door.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
And this is my bedroom. Also vintage. 1962 furniture set. Matching nightstands, dresser, vanity—

**MINA** accidentally bumps into a small table in the hallway. A **VINTAGE VASE** wobbles.

**SEMMI** lunges forward, catching it before it falls.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(sharply)*  
Careful! That's 1959 Murano glass! Irreplaceable!

**MINA**  
*(startled)*  
I'm so sorry, I didn't see—

**SEMMI**  
*(holding the vase)*  
You have to be AWARE. Pay attention. This isn't some regular house where nothing matters. Everything here has VALUE.

**MINA**  
*(quietly)*  
I understand. I'm sorry.

**SEMMI** carefully places the vase back, adjusting it to the exact position it was before.

**SEMMI**  
*(exhaling)*  
It's fine. Just... please. Be mindful.

The warmth from earlier is cracking. The group exchanges glances.

**BELLO**  
*(trying to lighten the mood)*  
Maybe we should head back downstairs? Give you some space up here?

**SEMMI**  
*(too quickly)*  
No! No, we're not done. I want to show you everything. You came here to SEE me. The real me. So you need to see ALL of it.

**RITA**  
*(gently)*  
We appreciate the tour, Semmi. Really. But maybe—

**SEMMI**  
*(insistent)*  
Just one more room. Please. It's important.

He walks to the last door at the end of the hall. Opens it.

---

### INT. STORAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A small room—the "half-room" he mentioned. Shelves line every wall, filled with meticulously labeled boxes. File cabinets. Binders. Everything organized with obsessive precision.

**SEMMI**  
*(gesturing)*  
This is where I keep everything. Documents. Receipts. Provenance papers for every piece I own. Authentication certificates. Purchase records going back eight years.

**NATALIE**  
*(impressed despite herself)*  
That's... very organized.

**SEMMI**  
*(earnestly)*  
You have to be. Otherwise it's just clutter. Just chaos. I can't live with chaos.

**MARIA** notices a box labeled "PERSONAL - DO NOT OPEN."

**MARIA**  
What's in that one?

**SEMMI**  
*(immediately)*  
Private. Not part of the tour.

His tone shuts down any further questions.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(clapping hands)*  
Alright! Tour complete! Let's head back downstairs. I'll make lunch. Real lunch this time. Something special.

He ushers everyone out, turning off the light and closing the door firmly.

---

### INT. SEMMI'S LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Everyone files back into the main space. The **DOCUMENTARY RADIO** still plays. The **SHOPPING CHANNEL** still runs on the TV.

**SEMMI** immediately goes to the kitchen, pulling out ingredients.

**SEMMI**  
I'm thinking pasta! Fresh pasta! I make it myself. Another one of my skills.

**BELLO**  
*(sitting back on the couch)*  
Semmi, you really don't have to—

**SEMMI**  
*(not listening)*  
No, no! I WANT to. You're my guests. My friends. This is what friends do. They share meals. They spend time together. Quality time.

**GOOMO**  
*(to Rita, quietly)*  
Is he okay?

**RITA**  
*(whispering back)*  
I don't know. He seems... intense.

**MR. HOLT** sits in the armchair (the one with the glittery sweater), forgetting about it. He shifts and feels something under him. Pulls out the sweater.

**MR. HOLT**  
Oh, sorry—

He starts to drape it back on the arm of the chair, casually.

**SEMMI**  
*(from kitchen, sharply)*  
Not like that!

Everyone turns.

**SEMMI** rushes over, takes the sweater from **MR. HOLT**, and drapes it **exactly** as it was before—precise folds, specific positioning.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(forcing calm)*  
It has to be a certain way. My mother's sweater. It has to be... correct.

**MR. HOLT**  
*(apologetic)*  
Of course. I'm sorry.

**SEMMI** stares at the sweater for a long moment, then turns back to the kitchen.

**SEMMI**  
Pasta. I'm making pasta.

He starts working, but his movements are more frantic now. Opening cabinets harder. Setting down pots with more force.

**NATALIE**  
*(to Bello, very quietly)*  
Maybe we should think about leaving soon.

**BELLO**  
*(nodding)*  
After lunch. We'll eat and then make an excuse.

**MAY** and **MARIA** are sitting on the floor, the vintage toy car between them.

**MARIA**  
*(to May, quietly)*  
He's acting kind of weird now.

**MAY**  
*(whispering)*  
I know. I want to go home.

**MINA** gets up and walks toward the kitchen.

**MINA**  
Semmi, can I help with anything?

**SEMMI**  
*(not looking at her)*  
I have a system.

**MINA**  
I know, but maybe just—

She reaches for a pot to move it aside.

**SEMMI**  
*(grabbing her wrist)*  
DON'T touch that!

**MINA** freezes. Everyone in the living room turns.

**SEMMI** releases her wrist immediately, stepping back.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(breathing heavily)*  
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just... that pot is in the right place. If you move it, then everything is wrong. The whole system collapses. You understand?

**MINA**  
*(backing away)*  
Yeah. I understand.

She returns to the living room, shaken.

**GOOMO** stands up.

**GOOMO**  
Hey, Semmi? You know what, I think we're actually pretty full from the sandwiches. Maybe we should—

**SEMMI**  
*(turning, manic brightness)*  
No! NO! I'm making lunch! You can't leave before lunch! That's rude! You wouldn't be rude to me, would you, Goomo?

**GOOMO**  
*(carefully)*  
Of course not, man. We'll stay for lunch.

**SEMMI**  
*(satisfied)*  
Good. That's good. Because we're having such a nice time. Everyone's having a nice time. Right?

Silence.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(more insistent)*  
RIGHT?

**EVERYONE**  
*(uncomfortably)*  
Yes. / Sure. / Right.

**SEMMI**  
*(smiling)*  
See? Nice time.

He turns back to the stove. Starts boiling water.

The group sits in tense silence. The **DOCUMENTARY RADIO** drones on. The **SHOPPING CHANNEL** host's enthusiasm feels grotesque now.

**BELLO** pulls out his phone, checking the time. **SEMMI** sees this in his peripheral vision.

**SEMMI**  
*(not turning around)*  
No phones at the table. House rule.

**BELLO**  
*(putting it away)*  
I wasn't—I was just checking the time.

**SEMMI**  
Time doesn't matter here. We're not on a schedule. Just... being together. That's what matters.

**MARIA** whispers to **RITA**.

**MARIA**  
I don't like this anymore.

**RITA**  
*(putting an arm around her)*  
It's okay. We'll leave after lunch.

**SEMMI**  
*(from kitchen)*  
What are you whispering about?

**RITA**  
*(startled)*  
Nothing! Just—talking to Maria.

**SEMMI**  
*(turning, smiling)*  
Well, talk louder! We're all friends here. No secrets among friends.

He turns back to cooking.

**MINA** goes to the kitchen area, opening the refrigerator to get something—a drink, a snack.

She pulls out a **BOX** of something.

**SEMMI** sees this and **STABS** a knife into the cutting board, right next to the box.

**MINA** jumps back, dropping the box.

**SEMMI**  
*(coldly)*  
I didn't say you could take that.

**MINA**  
*(angry now)*  
What the hell, Semmi?! You could have hurt me!

**SEMMI**  
But I didn't. I have excellent aim. You're overreacting.

**MINA**  
Overreacting?! You just—you can't just—

**MARIA** stands up.

**MARIA**  
Semmi, that wasn't nice.

**MAY**  
*(standing too)*  
Yeah! You scared Mina!

**SEMMI**  
*(turning to face them)*  
She was taking things without asking. In MY house. MY kitchen. MY food.

**MARIA**  
But you said we were friends! Friends share!

**SEMMI**  
*(voice rising)*  
Friends also ASK before taking! Friends respect boundaries! Friends follow the RULES!

**MINA**  
*(voice shaking)*  
You're crazy.

**SEMMI**  
*(dangerously quiet)*  
What did you call me?

**MINA**  
I said you're crazy. This whole thing—the newspaper clippings, the schedules, the way you flip out over every little thing—it's not normal!

**SEMMI**  
*(advancing slightly)*  
Not NORMAL? I'm the most organized person you'll ever meet! I have SYSTEMS! I have ROUTINES! That's the opposite of crazy!

**MARIA**  
*(loudly)*  
Stop yelling!

**MAY** starts crying.

**BELLO** stands up, moving toward the children.

**BELLO**  
Okay, that's enough. Semmi, I think we should go.

**SEMMI**  
*(blocking the path)*  
No. You're staying for lunch. I'm MAKING lunch.

**BELLO**  
The kids are upset. We need to leave.

**SEMMI**  
*(manic)*  
They're fine! Everyone's FINE! Sit down!

**GOOMO**  
*(standing)*  
Semmi, come on, man. Let's just calm down—

**SEMMI**  
I AM CALM!

He's very clearly not calm.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(to Mina)*  
Apologize.

**MINA**  
What?

**SEMMI**  
Apologize for calling me crazy. Apologize for taking my food. APOLOGIZE.

**MINA**  
*(defiantly)*  
No.

**SEMMI**'s face hardens.

**SEMMI**  
Then you can leave.

**MINA**  
Good! I'm going!

She grabs her bag and heads for the door.

**SEMMI** doesn't stop her. She leaves, slamming the door behind her.

The rest of the group stands frozen.

**SEMMI** turns back to the stove, stirring the pasta like nothing happened.

**SEMMI**  
*(cheerfully)*  
More food for the rest of us!

**NATALIE**  
*(quietly to Bello)*  
We need to leave. Now.

**BELLO**  
*(nodding)*  
Semmi? We're going to head out too. Thank you for having us, but—

**SEMMI**  
*(not turning)*  
No.

**BELLO**  
What?

**SEMMI**  
*(turning, holding a wooden spoon)*  
I said no. You came here to see me. The REAL me. And now you want to leave because I have standards? Because I expect respect in MY OWN HOME?

**RITA**  
*(carefully)*  
Semmi, we're not trying to be disrespectful. We're just—

**SEMMI**  
*(interrupting)*  
You're just like everyone else. Come to visit, pretend to care, then run away the moment things don't go exactly how YOU want. Well, not this time.

**MR. HOLT**  
*(standing)*  
Semmi, this has been lovely, but I really do need to—

**SEMMI**  
SIT. DOWN.

His voice is a command now, not a request.

**MR. HOLT** slowly sits back down.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
Everyone. Sit. We're going to eat lunch together like civilized people. And then—THEN—if you still want to leave, we'll talk about it.

**GOOMO**  
*(trying to reason)*  
Semmi, buddy, this isn't—

**SEMMI**  
*(pointing the spoon at him)*  
I am NOT your buddy. At work, maybe. But here? Here I'm the HOST. And you're the GUESTS. And guests follow the host's rules. Now. SIT.

One by one, reluctantly, they sit.

**MAY** is still crying softly. **MARIA** holds her hand, looking scared now.

**SEMMI** drains the pasta, begins plating it with exaggerated care.

The **DOCUMENTARY RADIO** continues its droning narration.

The **SHOPPING CHANNEL** continues its manic enthusiasm.

And nobody says a word.

**FADE OUT.**
