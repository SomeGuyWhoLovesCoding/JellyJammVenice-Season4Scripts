# SEASON 4, EPISODE 2: "THE OPULENCE OF SEMMI"
## ACT SEVEN - A TALK WITH THE POLICE

---

### EXT. SEMMI'S HOUSE - FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

**BELLO** stares at his phone, then at **MAY**.

**BELLO**  
*(quietly)*  
We can't stay here. We're freezing. And Semmi's not going to change his mind tonight.

**MAY**  
*(shivering)*  
Where do we go?

**BELLO**  
*(standing slowly)*  
Away from here. Somewhere we can think. Somewhere warm.

**MAY**  
What about everyone inside?

**BELLO**  
*(looking at the house)*  
I... I don't know. But we can't help them by freezing to death out here.

**MAY**  
*(standing)*  
Okay.

They walk away from the house, toward **BELLO**'s car parked down the street.

---

### INT. BELLO'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

**BELLO** starts the engine, cranks the heat up.

They sit there for a moment, hands held up to the vents, warming up.

**BELLO**  
*(quietly)*  
I can't believe this happened.

**MAY**  
Me neither.

**BELLO**  
We came here thinking it would be nice. Just a house visit. Getting to know Semmi better.

**MAY**  
*(softly)*  
And now everyone's trapped.

**BELLO**  
*(clenching the steering wheel)*  
I'm so angry at him. At Semmi. For what he did. To Maria. To You. To all of us.

**MAY**  
Me too.

**BELLO**  
*(turning to her)*  
We're not going back there, May. Ever. No matter what happens. That place—that man—he's not safe.

**MAY**  
What about our friends?

**BELLO**  
*(hesitating)*  
I... I want to help them. But I don't know how. If we call the police, Semmi might... he might make things worse for them before anyone can get there.

**MAY**  
So we just leave them?

**BELLO**  
*(anguished)*  
I don't know! I don't know what to do!

He sits there, gripping the wheel, struggling with the decision.

**BELLO** *(CONT'D)*  
*(after a moment)*  
Maybe... maybe we need to focus on what we CAN control. We can't save them right now. But we can... we can try to move forward. With our lives.

**MAY**  
*(quietly)*  
How?

**BELLO**  
*(thinking)*  
We go back to work. Remember the store? The mall? Where we used to work before all the robot stuff?

**MAY**  
*(perking up slightly)*  
The grocery store at the mall?

**BELLO**  
Yeah. I heard they're restoring it. Fixing everything that got damaged. Maybe they're hiring again. Maybe we can go back to that. Something simple. Something safe.

**MAY**  
That sounds nice.

**BELLO**  
*(nodding)*  
We'll create our own space. Away from all this chaos. Away from people like Semmi. Just... trying to be normal again.

**MAY**  
Just us?

**BELLO**  
*(hesitating)*  
For now, yeah. Just us. We need... we need distance. From today. From everything that happened.

**MAY** nods slowly, processing.

**BELLO** *(CONT'D)*  
*(pulling out phone)*  
Actually... I want to check in with the police. About the other case. The robot thing. See if there's been any updates.

**MAY**  
Why?

**BELLO**  
Because... because I need to know if that's really over. If we're safe from that, at least.

He dials a non-emergency police number he has saved.

### INT. POLICE STATION - DETECTIVE'S DESK - INTERCUT

**DETECTIVE MORGAN** (40s, sharp, kind eyes) answers.

**DETECTIVE MORGAN**  
Detective Morgan, how can I help you?

**BELLO**  
*(into phone)*  
Hi, Detective. This is Bello. From the... from the robot case. A few months ago?

**DETECTIVE MORGAN**  
*(recognizing the name)*  
Bello, yes. I remember. How are you doing?

**BELLO**  
I've been... it's been rough. But I wanted to check in. Has there been any progress on the case?

**DETECTIVE MORGAN**  
Actually, yes. We closed it last month. I was meaning to reach out to all the victims. I'm glad you called.

**BELLO**  
*(sitting up)*  
Closed? What did you find?

**DETECTIVE MORGAN**  
We successfully dissected the robot. Analyzed all its systems. And we found conclusive evidence that the "quasi-awareness" concept was not real.

**BELLO**  
*(staring)*  
What do you mean not real?

**DETECTIVE MORGAN**  
It was fabricated. The robot was sophisticated, yes, but it was never conscious. Never actually aware. The whole concept was part of a larger cult case.

**BELLO**  
A cult?

**DETECTIVE MORGAN**  
Yes. A group that's been operating for years, spreading false information about AI and robotics. Convincing people that certain machines had achieved consciousness. They had followers, believers, people who bought into the ideology.

**BELLO**  
And Queen Gbito?

**DETECTIVE MORGAN**  
She was one of their victims. She genuinely believed the robot was aware. She was manipulated by the cult's leadership into thinking she was part of something revolutionary.

**BELLO**  
*(processing)*  
So... she didn't know? She thought it was real?

**DETECTIVE MORGAN**  
That's correct. She's cooperating with the investigation now. Providing information about the cult's operations.

**BELLO**  
So the robot that attacked us—that destroyed the store—it wasn't... it wasn't actually alive?

**DETECTIVE MORGAN**  
No. It was advanced programming designed to mimic awareness. But it was just code. Just algorithms responding to inputs.

**BELLO**  
*(sitting back)*  
I... I don't know what to say. We all thought... we were so sure it was real.

**DETECTIVE MORGAN**  
That's what the cult wanted. They were very convincing. Very good at what they did.

**MAY**  
*(quietly, to Bello)*  
What's he saying?

**BELLO**  
*(to May)*  
The robot wasn't actually aware. It was all fake. Part of a cult.

**MAY** starts **CRYING**—not from fear, but from relief and exhaustion.

**MAY**  
I was so scared. I thought it was alive. I thought it wanted to hurt us.

**BELLO**  
*(pulling her close, into phone)*  
Detective, this is... this is a lot to process.

**DETECTIVE MORGAN**  
I understand. If you need counseling services, victim support, we can arrange that.

**BELLO**  
Thank you. I... I think we might need that.

**DETECTIVE MORGAN**  
Is there anything else I can help you with today?

**BELLO**  
*(hesitating)*  
No. No, that's all. Thank you for the update.

**DETECTIVE MORGAN**  
Take care, Bello. And if you need anything, don't hesitate to call.

**BELLO**  
I will. Thank you.

He hangs up.

**BELLO** *(CONT'D)*  
*(to May)*  
It's over. The robot case. It's really over.

**MAY**  
*(wiping tears)*  
Good. I'm glad.

**BELLO**  
Me too.

They sit in silence for a moment.

**MAY**  
*(quietly)*  
I miss the other kids. From our group. Maria and the others.

**BELLO**  
*(sadly)*  
I know. I miss them too.

**MAY**  
Do you think Gbito learned from what happened? From being part of that cult?

**BELLO**  
I hope so. The detective said she's helping now. Cooperating. Maybe she realizes what she was part of.

**MAY**  
I hope she doesn't hurt anyone else. Like... like what happened today.

**BELLO**  
*(looking at her)*  
What do you mean?

**MAY**  
Semmi hurt people. Me, Maria, All of us. I don't want Gbito to be like that.

**BELLO**  
*(quietly)*  
Neither do I.

**MAY**  
Do you think our friends will be okay? In there?

**BELLO**  
*(staring at the house in the distance)*  
I don't know, May. I really don't know.

**MAY**  
*(crying again)*  
I'm scared for them.

**BELLO**  
*(hugging her)*  
Me too. Me too.

They sit together in the car, the weight of everything pressing down on them.

**BELLO** *(CONT'D)*  
*(after a long moment)*  
Let's go. Let's go to the mall. See if the store is open. See if they're hiring.

**MAY**  
Now?

**BELLO**  
Yeah. I... I need to do something normal. Something that makes sense. I can't sit here thinking about... about all of this.

**MAY**  
Okay.

**BELLO** puts the car in drive and pulls away from Semmi's neighborhood.

Away from the house where their friends are still trapped.

Away from the nightmare of today.

Toward something—anything—that feels like moving forward.

---

### EXT. MALL - PARKING LOT - LATER

**BELLO** and **MAY** pull into the parking lot.

The mall is partially lit. Construction equipment visible. Signs of restoration work.

**MAY**  
*(looking around)*  
They're really fixing it.

**BELLO**  
*(nodding)*  
Looks like it.

They get out of the car and walk toward the entrance.

---

### EXT. MALL - ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

As they approach, they see **WORKERS** inside, renovating. The lights are on in some sections.

A sign on the door reads: **"REOPENING SOON - NOW HIRING"**

**BELLO**  
*(pointing)*  
See? They're hiring.

**MAY**  
Do you think they'll take you back?

**BELLO**  
Only one way to find out.

He tries the door. It's unlocked.

They step inside.

---

### INT. MALL - MAIN CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

The mall is half-restored. Some areas pristine, others still damaged from the robot incident.

**WORKERS** move around, carrying materials, operating tools.

A **FOREMAN** (50s, tired but friendly) notices them.

**FOREMAN**  
Help you folks?

**BELLO**  
Hi. I used to work at the grocery store here. Before the... before the incident. I saw you're hiring?

**FOREMAN**  
*(nodding)*  
Yeah. Store's reopening in a few weeks. Manager's here somewhere. Let me find him for you.

He walks off.

**MAY**  
*(looking around)*  
It looks different. Better, kind of.

**BELLO**  
They're putting a lot of work into it.

**MAY**  
Do you think it'll be safe? To work here again?

**BELLO**  
*(looking at her)*  
The robot's gone. The cult's been stopped. Yeah. I think it'll be safe.

**MAY**  
Good.

The **FOREMAN** returns with **MR. GORDON** (50s, manager, kind face).

**MR. GORDON**  
*(surprised)*  
Bello! May! I didn't expect to see you two!

**BELLO**  
*(shaking his hand)*  
Mr. Gordon. Good to see you.

**MR. GORDON**  
You too. What brings you here?

**BELLO**  
I saw you're hiring. I wanted to apply. Get back to work.

**MR. GORDON**  
*(smiling)*  
You were a good employee, Bello. As far as I'm concerned, your job's waiting for you. When can you start?

**BELLO**  
*(relieved)*  
Really? Just like that?

**MR. GORDON**  
The robot wasn't your fault. Store getting wrecked wasn't your fault. You were a victim, just like the rest of us. Of course I'll hire you back.

**BELLO**  
*(gratefully)*  
Thank you. Thank you so much.

**MR. GORDON**  
We're aiming to open in two weeks. Can you start then?

**BELLO**  
Yes. Absolutely.

**MR. GORDON**  
Good. I'll get the paperwork ready. Come by next week to fill it out.

**BELLO**  
I will. Thank you, Mr. Gordon.

**MR. GORDON**  
*(to May)*  
And you, young lady, are welcome here anytime. On the house—pick something from the store when we open. You've earned it.

**MAY**  
*(smiling slightly)*  
Thank you.

**MR. GORDON**  
*(to Bello)*  
You doing okay? After everything?

**BELLO**  
*(hesitating)*  
It's been... it's been a really hard day. But we're managing.

**MR. GORDON**  
Well, if you ever need to talk, my door's open. We all went through something traumatic here.

**BELLO**  
I appreciate that.

**MR. GORDON**  
Alright. I'll let you two go. See you next week?

**BELLO**  
Next week.

**MR. GORDON** heads back to oversee the workers.

**BELLO** and **MAY** stand there, looking around the half-restored mall.

**BELLO**  
*(quietly)*  
We did it. We got the job back.

**MAY**  
Yeah.

**BELLO**  
This is our fresh start, May. Our own space. Away from all the chaos.

**MAY**  
*(looking at him)*  
What about everyone else? Our friends?

**BELLO**  
*(voice heavy)*  
I don't know. I hope... I hope they find their way out. That they're okay.

**MAY**  
Do you think we'll ever see them again?

**BELLO**  
*(after a long pause)*  
I don't know.

They stand in silence, the sound of construction around them.

A new beginning.

But one shadowed by everything they've left behind.

**FADE OUT.**
