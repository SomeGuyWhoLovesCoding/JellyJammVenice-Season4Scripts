# SEASON 4, EPISODE 2: "THE OPULENCE OF SEMMI"
## ACT SIX - BREAK

---

### EXT. FIFTH WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

**BELLO** sits in the snow, phone still in his hand, tears still streaming down his face.

**MAY** huddles beside him, shivering.

Minutes pass in silence.

Just the sound of wind. Snow falling. The distant hum of the **DOCUMENTARY RADIO** still playing inside.

**BELLO**  
*(hoarsely)*  
I have to try one more time.

**MAY**  
*(quietly)*  
Who?

**BELLO**  
Goomo. Maybe... maybe he'll understand. Maybe he can help.

He pulls up **GOOMO**'s contact with shaking hands.

Dials.

Waits.

---

### INT. CLOSET - SAME TIME

**GOOMO** is crammed in the small space with **RITA**, **MINA**, **MR. HOLT**, and **NATALIE**.

The smell is overwhelming. The air is stuffy. Everyone's uncomfortable, sweating despite the cold outside.

His phone **BUZZES**.

He pulls it out. **BELLO**'s name.

Miraculously, there's just enough signal—one bar.

**GOOMO**  
*(whispering)*  
I have to answer this. It's Bello.

**RITA**  
*(whispering)*  
Be careful. Don't let Semmi hear.

**GOOMO** answers, speaking as quietly as possible.

**GOOMO**  
*(into phone, barely audible)*  
Bello?

---

### INTERCUT - BELLO OUTSIDE / GOOMO IN CLOSET

**BELLO**  
*(relief washing over him)*  
Goomo! Oh thank god! You answered!

**GOOMO**  
*(whispering)*  
I can barely hear you. Hold on—

He adjusts the phone, pressing it closer to his ear.

**GOOMO** *(CONT'D)*  
Okay. I'm here. What's happening out there?

**BELLO**  
*(voice breaking)*  
Everything's falling apart. I tried talking to Semmi. Through all five windows. He closed every curtain. Then I called Mr. Holt—no answer. Called Maria—she hung up on me. She didn't understand anything I was saying. Nobody understands.

**GOOMO**  
*(trying to follow)*  
Okay, slow down. Start from the beginning. What happened after he kicked you out?

**BELLO**  
He kicked us out and I tried to apologize. I went to each window—all five of them—and I begged him to let everyone go. To forgive me. But he just... he just closed the curtains. One by one. Like he was shutting me out completely.

**GOOMO**  
*(processing)*  
Okay. Okay, that's... that's bad. But you're safe? You and May?

**BELLO**  
We're outside. In the snow. We're freezing but we're okay. Goomo, I don't know what to do. I told him I was innocent. I told him everything.

**GOOMO**  
*(confused)*  
Innocent of what?

**BELLO**  
*(frustrated)*  
Of everything! Of what I said! The Nazi thing, the grandpa thing—it was all a mistake! I was just scared!

**GOOMO**  
*(gently)*  
Bello, nobody thinks you're guilty of anything. You were trying to protect May. We all saw that.

**BELLO**  
But Semmi doesn't see it that way! He thinks... he thinks I was judging him. Mocking him.

**GOOMO**  
*(carefully)*  
Were you?

**BELLO**  
NO! I mean... maybe in the moment, I said things I shouldn't have. But I didn't mean them. Not really.

**GOOMO**  
Then that's what you tell him. When you get the chance.

**BELLO**  
I DID tell him! Through five windows! He won't listen!

**GOOMO** pauses, trying to think of what to say.

**GOOMO**  
Okay. New approach. Has he... has he been watching anything? Any political stuff? Any news?

**BELLO**  
*(confused)*  
What? No. He hates the news. He freaked out when it came on TV. Why?

**GOOMO**  
I'm just trying to understand what set him off. If he saw something political, or if someone mentioned... I don't know, the Nazis or—

**BELLO**  
*(defensive)*  
I mentioned the Nazis! That was ME! I said he acted like he lived in the Nazi era! That's what started all of this!

**GOOMO**  
*(carefully)*  
Okay, but did he ever actually talk about that stuff before? Like, did he have opinions about politics or history or—

**BELLO**  
*(frustrated)*  
I don't know, Goomo! I don't know anything about him! None of us do! That's the whole problem!

**GOOMO**  
*(trying to calm him)*  
You're right. You're right. I'm sorry. I'm just trying to help.

**BELLO**  
*(quieter)*  
I know. I know you are.

Silence for a moment.

**GOOMO**  
*(carefully)*  
You said Semmi messed with Maria and May really badly. What did he do?

**BELLO**  
*(voice shaking)*  
He put Maria in a high chair. Made her sit there even though she's thirteen. And when she told him it hurt—because she's transgender and the chair was pressing wrong—he ripped her shirt. Exposed her. Then locked her in a closet with his dog and dog shit.

**GOOMO**  
*(horrified, louder)*  
He WHAT?

**RITA** *(in background, whispering)*  
Goomo, quiet!

**GOOMO**  
*(lowering voice)*  
Sorry. Sorry. But... Jesus, Bello. That's... that's assault. That's abuse.

**BELLO**  
I know. And Rita—she was trying to protect May from being sent to a high chair. Just for asking if he was okay. That's when we should have left. That's when we should have known.

**GOOMO**  
We couldn't have known. He seemed fine at first.

**BELLO**  
But he wasn't fine. He was never fine. We just didn't see it.

**GOOMO**  
None of us saw it. Not even Officer James, and he's worked with Semmi for three years.

**BELLO**  
*(bitterly)*  
James doesn't know him either. Semmi said so himself. Said James has no idea who he really is.

**GOOMO**  
*(quietly)*  
That's terrifying.

**BELLO**  
I know.

Another pause.

Suddenly, **MAY**'s voice in the background.

**MAY** *(distant)*  
Bello? Can I talk to Goomo?

**BELLO**  
*(to May)*  
May, not right now—

**MAY**  
*(closer)*  
Please? I want to talk to him.

**BELLO**  
*(sighing)*  
Hold on. May wants to talk.

He hands the phone to **MAY**.

**MAY**  
*(into phone)*  
Goomo?

**GOOMO**  
*(gentle)*  
Hey, May. You doing okay?

**MAY**  
*(voice small)*  
Not really. I'm cold. And scared. And I miss everyone.

**GOOMO**  
I miss you too, kiddo. We all do.

**MAY**  
Is Maria okay? I heard Bello say Semmi hurt her.

**GOOMO**  
*(carefully)*  
She's okay. She's strong. Just like you.

**MAY**  
I called him grandpa. That's what made him mad.

**GOOMO**  
That's not your fault, May. You didn't do anything wrong.

**MAY**  
*(crying)*  
But he got so mad. And then Bello said that thing about Nazis and everything got worse.

**GOOMO**  
Listen to me. None of this is your fault. Or Bello's fault. Semmi is... he's not well. He's not thinking clearly. That's not on you.

**MAY**  
*(sniffling)*  
When can we come inside? I'm really cold.

**GOOMO**  
*(voice breaking)*  
I don't know, sweetheart. But soon. I promise. We'll figure this out soon.

**MAY**  
Okay.

**BELLO** *(in background)*  
May, let me talk to him again.

**MAY**  
Bye, Goomo.

**GOOMO**  
Bye, May. Stay strong.

She hands the phone back to **BELLO**.

**BELLO**  
*(into phone)*  
I didn't mean for her to join. That wasn't supposed to happen.

**GOOMO**  
It's okay. She needed to hear a friendly voice.

**BELLO**  
What do I do, Goomo? How do I fix this?

**GOOMO**  
*(thinking)*  
You might not be able to. Not tonight. Semmi's too far gone. He's locked us in here, he's locked Maria behind that gate, he won't talk to you... Bello, I think you need to call the police.

**BELLO**  
And say what? He'll just deny everything. Say we're lying. Say we're harassing him.

**GOOMO**  
Then you tell them the truth. About Maria. About the shirt. About all of it. They'll have to investigate.

**BELLO**  
*(defeated)*  
Maybe. Maybe you're right.

**GOOMO**  
Do it. Call them. Get help. We can't get out of here on our own.

**BELLO**  
Okay. Okay, I will.

**GOOMO**  
And Bello? Stop saying you're innocent. You ARE innocent. You don't have to keep proving it.

**BELLO**  
*(quietly)*  
Thank you.

**GOOMO**  
We'll get through this. I promise.

**BELLO**  
I hope so.

**GOOMO**  
I have to go. My phone's dying and I need to save battery.

**BELLO**  
Okay. Stay safe in there.

**GOOMO**  
You too out there.

They hang up.

### INT. CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

**GOOMO** lowers the phone, staring at the dark screen.

**RITA**  
*(whispering)*  
What did he say?

**GOOMO**  
*(quietly)*  
He's breaking down. May's freezing. Semmi won't talk to them. He's going to call the police.

**MINA**  
*(whispering)*  
Finally. We should have called them hours ago.

**MR. HOLT**  
*(whispering)*  
Hard to call when you're locked in a closet with no signal.

**NATALIE**  
*(whispering)*  
How much battery do you have left?

**GOOMO**  
*(checking)*  
Twelve percent. We need to conserve it.

He powers off the phone.

They sit in silence in the dark, cramped closet.

**RITA**  
*(whispering)*  
Do you think the police will come?

**GOOMO**  
*(whispering)*  
If Bello calls them, yeah. They'll have to.

**MINA**  
*(whispering)*  
And what if Semmi doesn't let them in?

**MR. HOLT**  
*(whispering)*  
They'll break the door down. They'll get us out.

**NATALIE**  
*(whispering)*  
I hope you're right.

They fall silent again.

The smell. The cramped space. The fear.

Waiting.

### EXT. FIFTH WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

**BELLO** sits in the snow, phone in hand.

**MAY** sits beside him, shivering.

**BELLO**  
*(to May)*  
Goomo says I should call the police.

**MAY**  
Are you going to?

**BELLO**  
*(staring at his phone)*  
I don't know. What if it makes things worse?

**MAY**  
How could it get worse?

**BELLO** doesn't have an answer for that.

He looks at the house—all curtains closed, all lights on inside, but no movement visible.

**BELLO**  
*(quietly)*  
I don't know what to do anymore.

**MAY**  
*(leaning against him)*  
Me neither.

They sit there in the snow.

The **SAD MUSIC** continues softly.

The wind blows.

The snow falls.

And inside the house, everyone waits.

**FADE OUT.**
