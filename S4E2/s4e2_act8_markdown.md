# SEASON 4, EPISODE 2: "THE OPULENCE OF SEMMI"
## ACT EIGHT - WHEN IT WILL CONTINUE (FINAL ACT)

---

### INT. SEMMI'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The house is quiet now. Eerily quiet.

**GOOMO**, **MINA**, **RITA**, **MR. HOLT**, and **NATALIE** are still in the closet. The door is no longer locked—**SEMMI** abandoned it hours ago, retreating upstairs after the "event."

**GOOMO**  
*(whispering)*  
I think he's gone. Upstairs.

**MINA**  
*(whispering back)*  
Are you sure?

**GOOMO**  
I haven't heard anything in over an hour. We need to get out of here.

**RITA**  
*(quietly)*  
Agreed. Slowly.

**GOOMO** carefully opens the closet door.

It **CREAKS** slightly.

They all freeze.

Silence.

No response from upstairs.

They emerge slowly, one by one, into the living room.

**MARIA** is still behind the baby gate, asleep, exhausted.

The **DOCUMENTARY RADIO** has finally been turned off.

The **TV** is dark.

Just silence. And the sound of wind outside.

**NATALIE**  
*(looking around)*  
Where do we go?

**MR. HOLT**  
We can't leave. Not in this weather. Look.

He points to the window. Through a gap in the curtains, heavy snow is visible, falling steadily.

**MINA**  
So we just... stay here? With him upstairs?

**GOOMO**  
*(tiredly)*  
I don't think he's coming back down. Not after what happened.

**RITA**  
*(spotting something)*  
Look. A blanket.

She walks to a storage chest near the couch, opens it, pulls out a **GOLDEN CLOTH BLANKET**—soft, luxurious, probably another one of Semmi's vintage finds.

**RITA** *(CONT'D)*  
We should rest. Just for a bit. Until we figure out what to do.

**NATALIE**  
On his couch? With his blanket?

**RITA**  
*(exhausted)*  
I don't care anymore. I just need to sit. To breathe.

**MR. HOLT**  
She's right. We need rest. We can't think clearly like this.

They all move to the mid-century couch and the loveseat—crowding together.

**GOOMO** goes to the baby gate, gently unlocks it.

**GOOMO**  
*(softly)*  
Maria. Come on. Come sit with us.

**MARIA** stirs, opens her eyes.

**MARIA**  
*(groggily)*  
Is it over?

**GOOMO**  
For now. Come on.

He helps her up. She joins the others.

They all huddle together on the couches, pulling the **GOLDEN BLANKET** over themselves.

Cramped. Uncomfortable. But together.

Safe, for the moment.

**MINA**  
*(quietly)*  
Do you think he'll come back down?

**GOOMO**  
*(shaking his head)*  
No. I don't think so. Not tonight.

**RITA**  
How do you know?

**GOOMO**  
I don't. But... after everything that happened. After the "event." I think he's done. For tonight, at least.

**NATALIE**  
The "event." Is that what we're calling it?

**MR. HOLT**  
*(closing his eyes)*  
Let's not talk about it. Not now. Let's just... rest.

They fall silent.

The golden blanket covers them like a protective shield.

Outside, the wind howls.

The snow continues to fall.

But inside, for the first time in hours, there's quiet.

One by one, exhausted, traumatized, they drift off to sleep.

---

### INT. SEMMI'S LIVING ROOM - DAWN

Light filters through the windows.

**GOOMO** wakes first, blinking against the brightness.

He looks toward the window—and freezes.

A **WALL OF WHITE SNOW** presses against the glass, visible through the **YELLOW CURTAIN** that Semmi had drawn earlier.

The combination of the white snow and yellow curtain creates an eerie **GOLDEN GLOW** throughout the room.

Everything looks surreal. Dreamlike. Wrong.

**GOOMO**  
*(quietly)*  
Oh my god.

**MINA** stirs beside him.

**MINA**  
*(groggily)*  
What?

**GOOMO**  
*(pointing)*  
Look.

She looks. Her eyes widen.

**MINA**  
That's... that's a lot of snow.

**RITA** wakes next. Then **MR. HOLT**. Then **NATALIE**. Then **MARIA**.

They all stare at the wall of golden-white light.

**NATALIE**  
*(quietly)*  
We're snowed in.

**MR. HOLT**  
Completely.

**MARIA**  
*(pulling the golden blanket tighter)*  
What do we do?

Silence.

No one has an answer.

They just sit there, huddled under the golden blanket, staring at the golden-white glow.

**RITA**  
*(after a long moment)*  
What's going to happen to us?

**GOOMO**  
*(quietly)*  
I don't know.

**MINA**  
Do you think Bello and May are okay?

**NATALIE**  
I hope so.

**MR. HOLT**  
Do you think anyone's coming for us?

**GOOMO**  
Eventually. When the snow clears. When someone realizes we're missing.

**RITA**  
And until then?

**GOOMO**  
*(looking around)*  
Until then... we wait.

**MARIA**  
*(looking toward the stairs)*  
What about him? Semmi?

They all glance toward the staircase.

Silence from above.

**GOOMO**  
He won't come down. Not after what happened. I'm sure of it.

**MINA**  
How can you be sure?

**GOOMO**  
I can't. But... I just know. He's done. He's up there, probably sitting in his room, staring at nothing. Just like we're down here.

**NATALIE**  
So we're just... stuck. In limbo.

**MR. HOLT**  
For now.

They sit in silence again.

The golden light fills the room.

The golden blanket covers them.

Everything is still.

Everything is waiting.

**RITA**  
*(quietly)*  
I'm scared.

**GOOMO**  
*(putting an arm around her)*  
Me too.

**MINA**  
I keep thinking... what if this happens again? What if there's someone else out there? Another person like Semmi?

**NATALIE**  
We can't think like that.

**MINA**  
But what if it's true? What if we can't trust anyone anymore?

**MARIA**  
*(softly)*  
We can trust each other. Right?

They all look at each other.

**GOOMO**  
*(nodding)*  
Yeah. We can trust each other.

**RITA**  
We made it through this. Together.

**MR. HOLT**  
We'll make it through whatever comes next. Together.

**NATALIE**  
*(trying to believe it)*  
Together.

They huddle closer under the golden blanket.

The wall of white snow glows golden through the yellow curtain.

Time passes.

Minutes become hours.

They don't move.

They just sit.

And think.

And wait.

About what's going to happen.

About what comes next.

About whether they'll ever feel safe again.

But for now, in this moment, wrapped in the golden blanket, bathed in golden light—

They're together.

And that's enough.

For now.

### EXT. ABOVE THE CLOUDS - SUNSET

The camera is now entirely above the cloud layer.

The sky is vast. Endless.

The sun begins to set on the horizon—oranges, pinks, purples streaking across the sky.

Beautiful.

Peaceful.

Indifferent to the suffering below.

The sunset deepens.

The colors intensify.

Then begin to fade.

Darker.

And darker.

The sun slips below the horizon.

The sky transitions from color to grey.

From grey to dark blue.

From dark blue to black.

The sunset fades away completely.

**DARKNESS.**

**SILENCE.**

Below the clouds, somewhere in that white frozen world:

**SEMMI** is still in his house.

**GOOMO**, **MINA**, **RITA**, **MR. HOLT**, **NATALIE**, and **MARIA** are somewhere, trying to recover.

**BELLO** and **MAY** are starting their new jobs, trying to move on.

And the question hangs in the air:

**What happens next?**

**Who will they become after this?**

**And will another creepy figure emerge to test them again?**

The screen stays black.

They drive in silence.

Watching the snow fall outside.

### EXT. SKY - DAY ONE

The camera pulls back from the car.

Rising up.

Above the neighborhood.

Above the town.

The snow covers everything below—a blanket of white.

---

### EXT. SKY - DAY TWO

The camera continues rising.

The snow continues falling.

Days pass in time-lapse.

More snow.

More white.

Everything buried.

---

### EXT. SKY - DAY THREE

The camera rises higher still.

Above the clouds now.

The sun breaks through—golden, warm, beautiful.

But below, hidden beneath the clouds, the world is frozen.

Trapped.

Waiting.
