# SEASON 4, EPISODE 2: "THE OPULENCE OF SEMMI"
## ACT FIVE - FALLING ACTION

---

### EXT. SEMMI'S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

**BELLO** leans against the door, sliding down to sit on the front step.

**MAY** sits beside him, both shivering in the cold.

**BELLO**  
*(quietly)*  
He won't even talk to us anymore.

**MAY**  
What do we do now?

**BELLO** looks around. Sees the **WINDOWS**—all with curtains still visible from outside.

**BELLO**  
*(standing)*  
The windows. Maybe... maybe if I try again. Through the windows. Maybe he'll listen.

**MAY**  
You already tried that.

**BELLO**  
I have to try again. I can't just sit here.

He walks to the **FIRST WINDOW**.

---

### EXT. FIRST WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

**BELLO** approaches, sees the curtain is open slightly—he can see inside to the living room.

**BELLO**  
*(calling through glass)*  
Semmi! I know you can hear me! Please! I was wrong! I was so wrong!

Inside, he sees **SEMMI** sitting on the mid-century couch, staring at nothing.

**BELLO** *(CONT'D)*  
I never should have said those things! I was scared! We all were! But that's no excuse! You didn't deserve that!

**SEMMI** slowly turns his head toward the window.

Looks at **BELLO** through the glass.

Then stands and walks toward the window.

**BELLO** *(CONT'D)*  
*(hopeful)*  
Semmi, please—

**SEMMI** reaches up and **CLOSES THE CURTAIN**.

**BELLO** steps back, staring at the now-closed curtain.

**BELLO** *(CONT'D)*  
*(voice breaking)*  
No... please...

---

### EXT. SECOND WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

**BELLO** runs to the next window, **MAY** following.

The curtain here is still open.

**BELLO**  
*(banging on glass)*  
Semmi! Listen to me! I was falsely kicked out! I didn't do anything wrong! It was a misunderstanding!

Through the window, **SEMMI** appears, walking toward them from inside.

**BELLO** *(CONT'D)*  
I'm innocent! I've always been innocent! You know me! We worked together! We trusted each other!

**SEMMI** reaches the window.

Looks **BELLO** directly in the eyes.

**CLOSES THE SECOND CURTAIN**.

**BELLO**  
*(desperately)*  
SEMMI!

---

### EXT. THIRD WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

**BELLO** stumbles to the third window, tears streaming down his face now.

**BELLO**  
*(pounding on glass)*  
Please! Please listen! There's no reason for this! I didn't deserve to be kicked out! I was just trying to protect May! I was trying to help!

**SEMMI** appears in the window.

**BELLO** *(CONT'D)*  
I'M INNOCENT! Do you hear me?! INNOCENT! I never wanted any of this! I never wanted to hurt you!

**SEMMI** stares at him for a long moment.

Then **CLOSES THE THIRD CURTAIN**.

**BELLO** slams his hands against the glass once more, then leans his forehead against the cold window.

**BELLO** *(CONT'D)*  
*(whispering)*  
Why...

---

### EXT. FOURTH WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

**BELLO** moves to the fourth window, barely able to stand now.

**MAY** stays close, crying quietly.

**BELLO**  
*(weakly)*  
Semmi... I'm begging you. One more chance. Just one more chance to explain.

Through the window, he can see **SEMMI** approaching.

**BELLO** *(CONT'D)*  
I'm innocent. I've always been innocent. You have to believe me. You HAVE to.

**SEMMI** reaches the window.

His expression is blank. Empty.

**CLOSES THE FOURTH CURTAIN**.

**BELLO** staggers back.

**BELLO** *(CONT'D)*  
*(to himself)*  
One more. There's one more.

---

### EXT. FIFTH WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

**BELLO** approaches the final window.

The last one still open.

**BELLO**  
*(barely able to speak)*  
Semmi. This is it. The last window. The last chance.

**SEMMI** appears, standing at the window.

**BELLO** *(CONT'D)*  
I was innocent. I AM innocent. Everything I said—I didn't mean it. I was trying to protect the kids. I was trying to keep everyone safe. That's all I've ever tried to do.

**SEMMI** just stares at him.

**BELLO** *(CONT'D)*  
*(voice breaking completely)*  
Please. Don't close this one. Please. If you close this one, I... I don't know what to do. I don't know how to help them. How to help YOU.

**SEMMI**'s hand reaches for the curtain.

**BELLO** *(CONT'D)*  
*(sobbing)*  
I'm innocent...

**SEMMI** **CLOSES THE LAST CURTAIN**.

**BELLO** stares at the closed curtain.

All five windows now sealed shut.

No way to see inside.

No way to reach Semmi.

**BELLO** drops to his knees in the snow.

Then collapses forward onto his hands, **CRAWLING** in the snow, sobbing uncontrollably.

**BELLO** *(CONT'D)*  
*(through tears)*  
I'm innocent... I didn't do anything... why... why won't you listen...

**SAD MUSIC** floods in—overwhelming, heartbreaking.

**MAY** kneels beside him, putting a hand on his shoulder.

**MAY**  
*(crying)*  
Bello...

**BELLO** just stays there in the snow, broken.

After a long moment, he pulls out his phone with shaking hands.

**BELLO**  
*(voice hoarse)*  
I have to... I have to call someone. I have to tell someone what happened.

He scrolls through his contacts.

Finds **MR. HOLT**.

Dials.

---

### INT. CLOSET - SAME TIME

**MR. HOLT** is crammed in the closet with the others. His phone buzzes.

He pulls it out, sees it's **BELLO**.

But there's **NO SIGNAL** inside the closet—too deep in the house, or perhaps Semmi's jammer is still active.

The call doesn't connect.

---

### EXT. FIFTH WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

**BELLO** listens to the phone ring.

And ring.

And ring.

Goes to voicemail.

**BELLO**  
*(into phone, voice shaking)*  
Mr. Holt... it's Bello. Something happened. Something really bad. Semmi... he kicked us out. May and me. And I tried to talk to him. Through the windows. All five of them. And he... he closed every curtain. He won't listen. He won't... I don't know what actually happened. I don't understand any of it. I just... I need to talk to someone. Please call me back.

He hangs up.

Stares at the phone.

Then scrolls to **MARIA**.

Dials.

---

### INT. LIVING ROOM - BABY GATE AREA - SAME TIME

**MARIA** is still behind the baby gate, curled up.

Her phone is in her pocket.

It **BUZZES**.

She pulls it out, sees **BELLO**'s name.

Answers quietly.

**MARIA**  
*(whispering)*  
Bello?

---

### EXT. FIFTH WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

**BELLO**  
*(relief flooding his voice)*  
Maria! Oh thank god! Are you okay? Is everyone okay?

---

### INTERCUT - BELLO OUTSIDE / MARIA INSIDE

**MARIA**  
*(whispering)*  
I'm... I'm behind a baby gate. The others are in the closet still. Semmi's in another room. I can hear him moving around.

**BELLO**  
Maria, I need you to understand something. What happened today—it wasn't right. Semmi... he wasn't acting normal. But I'm innocent. I didn't do anything to deserve being kicked out.

**MARIA**  
*(confused)*  
What do you mean innocent? Bello, you were trying to help us.

**BELLO**  
I know! That's what I'm saying! I was innocent! I've always been innocent! And I've seen things—terrible things—like that incident at the milk shop, remember? And that time with the felonious charges—when she pounded her own hair fungi and it disgusted Officer James—

**MARIA**  
*(lost)*  
Bello, I... I don't understand what you're talking about. What milk shop? What hair fungi?

**BELLO**  
You don't remember? The form! The milk shop form! And the fungi—it was so disgusting—

**MARIA**  
*(overwhelmed)*  
Bello, I'm thirteen and I've been locked behind a baby gate for hours. I don't know what any of that means. I can't... I can't help you right now.

**BELLO**  
But Maria, you have to understand—I'm INNOCENT!

**MARIA**  
*(starting to cry)*  
I never understood anything today! Nothing makes sense! I just want to go home!

**BELLO**  
Wait, Maria, please—

**MARIA**  
I'm sorry, Bello. I can't... I can't do this.

She **HANGS UP**.

---

### EXT. FIFTH WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

**BELLO** stares at his phone.

**BELLO**  
*(to himself)*  
She hung up. She... she hung up on me.

He starts crying again, harder now.

**BELLO** *(CONT'D)*  
*(through sobs)*  
I'm innocent... why doesn't anyone believe me... I'm innocent...

**MAY** huddles next to him, not knowing what to say.

**BELLO** sits in the snow, crying, the phone still in his hand.

The **SAD MUSIC** continues.

The house looms above them, all curtains closed, everyone trapped inside.

**FADE OUT.**
