# SEASON 4, EPISODE 2: "THE OPULENCE OF SEMMI"
## ACT FOUR

---

### INT. SEMMI'S LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

**SEMMI** sits on the mid-century couch, still talking about his radio collection. His voice is monotonous now, almost robotic.

**SEMMI**  
...and the transistor technology revolutionized portable audio in 1963. Before that, tube radios were too large, too fragile for—

**MAY** has gone quiet in the high chair, exhausted from crying. Just soft hiccups now.

**BELLO** stares at **SEMMI**, rage and fear mixing in his expression.

Suddenly, the **CLOSET DOOR** rattles.

Then **BANGS** from the inside.

**MARIA** *(muffled, triumphant)*  
I did it! I got him out! The dog moved!

The door rattles more as she tries the handle from inside.

**MARIA** *(CONT'D, muffled)*  
Can someone unlock this? Please?

**SEMMI** stops mid-sentence, staring at the closet door.

**SEMMI**  
*(quietly)*  
She got Paddy out?

**BELLO**  
*(standing)*  
Let her out, Semmi.

**SEMMI** doesn't move. Just stares at the door.

**MARIA** *(muffled)*  
Hello? I shooed him away! He's not in here anymore! Can I come out now?

**SEMMI** slowly stands, walking toward the closet door.

**SEMMI**  
*(dangerously calm)*  
You moved my dog.

**MARIA** *(muffled)*  
He was just laying there! I needed space to sit! Please let me out!

**SEMMI** unlocks the door. Opens it.

---

### INT. CLOSET/SMALL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

**MARIA** stands there, disheveled, tear-streaked face, but relieved. **PADDY** is no longer in the room—just the mess he left behind.

**MARIA**  
Thank you! I finally got him to—

**SEMMI**  
*(cold)*  
Get out.

**MARIA**  
*(confused)*  
What?

**SEMMI**  
Out of my house. NOW.

---

### INT. SEMMI'S LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

**MARIA** steps out of the closet, confused and scared.

**MARIA**  
I... I don't understand. I just—

**SEMMI**  
You moved MY dog! In MY house! Without permission!

**BELLO**  
*(stepping between them)*  
She was stuck in a room with dog waste! What did you expect her to do?!

**SEMMI**  
*(to Bello)*  
Stay out of this!

**BELLO**  
No! You've been terrorizing us all day! You locked her up, you locked May in a chair, you've been—

**SEMMI**  
*(advancing on Maria)*  
I want you OUT!

**MARIA**  
*(backing away)*  
I'm sorry! I didn't mean—

**BELLO**  
*(protective, stepping in front of Maria)*  
You're not kicking her out. She's thirteen. She's staying with us.

**SEMMI**  
*(laughing bitterly)*  
Protecting her? Protecting her "role"? What role? The troublemaker? The disrespectful child who touches things that aren't hers?

**BELLO**  
She's a KID who you traumatized!

**SEMMI**  
And you're enabling her!

He reaches past **BELLO** and grabs **MARIA**'s shirt—a favorite shirt, clearly worn and loved.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
You think you can just do whatever you want in my house?

He **RIPS** the shirt—tearing it right down the front.

**MARIA** gasps, clutching the torn fabric. Her bra is now visible underneath.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(mockingly)*  
IS THAT YOUR FAVORITE SHIRT NOW, HUH!?

**MARIA** starts crying, trying to hold the torn shirt together.

**MINA**  
*(standing, furious)*  
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!

**SEMMI**  
*(turning to her)*  
You. You're still here? I thought you left!

**MINA**  
*(advancing)*  
She's THIRTEEN! You just ripped her clothes off! Do you understand how messed up that is?!

**SEMMI**  
I didn't rip her clothes OFF, I ripped her SHIRT—

**MINA**  
You exposed a child! A child you already humiliated! A child you locked in a room with dog shit!

**GOOMO**  
*(standing)*  
Semmi, this has gone way too far—

**SEMMI**  
*(spinning around)*  
TOO FAR?! You all came into MY HOUSE! MY SPACE! And you disrespected EVERYTHING!

**NATALIE**  
We didn't disrespect anything! We've been trying to leave for hours!

**SEMMI**  
*(breathing heavily)*  
Everyone. SHUT UP.

He looks around wildly.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
I need... I need to think. I need QUIET. I need CONTROL.

He walks to the kitchen, grabs his key ring.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
New plan. EVERYONE in the closet. Right now.

**BELLO**  
Absolutely not—

**SEMMI**  
*(pointing at him)*  
EVERYONE except you and May. You two—you're leaving. Get out.

**BELLO**  
What? No! We're not leaving without—

**SEMMI**  
*(advancing)*  
You want to protect people? You want to be the HERO? Then GET OUT before I make you regret staying!

**MAY**  
*(from high chair, small voice)*  
Bello... I want to go...

**BELLO** looks torn—between protecting the others and protecting May.

**SEMMI**  
*(to Goomo, Rita, Mina, Mr. Holt, Natalie)*  
Everyone else. Closet. NOW. Until I deal with Paddy and move him somewhere proper.

**GOOMO**  
We're not—

**SEMMI** pulls out his PHONE.

**SEMMI**  
I will call the police and say you're trespassing. Threatening me. I'll say you tried to steal from me. Who do you think they'll believe? The ranger who works with Officer James, or a group of people who forced their way into my home?

**MR. HOLT**  
*(carefully)*  
Semmi, we have children here. This is—

**SEMMI**  
THE CHILDREN ARE LEAVING! Bello and May—OUT! The rest of you—CLOSET!

**BELLO**  
I'm not leaving them—

**MAY**  
*(crying)*  
Bello, please! I'm scared! I want to go home!

**BELLO** looks at **MAY**, then at the others.

**RITA**  
*(to Bello, quietly)*  
Take her. Get her safe. We'll be okay.

**GOOMO**  
*(nodding)*  
Get May out of here. Call the police once you're out.

**BELLO**  
*(conflicted)*  
I can't just leave you—

**SEMMI**  
*(screaming)*  
GET! OUT!

He moves toward them threateningly.

**BELLO** rushes to **MAY**, lifts her out of the high chair.

**MAY**  
*(clinging to him)*  
What about everyone else?

**BELLO**  
*(to the group)*  
I'll get help. I promise. I'll—

**SEMMI**  
You'll leave. That's what you'll do.

He ushers **BELLO** and **MAY** toward the door, unlocks it, pushes them toward it.

**MAY**  
*(looking back at the others, then to Semmi)*  
Good night... grandpa.

She says it without thinking—probably something she says to older people habitually.

**SEMMI** freezes.

**SEMMI**  
*(slowly)*  
What did you call me?

**MAY**  
*(scared)*  
I... I just... good night?

**SEMMI**  
Grandpa. You called me GRANDPA.

**BELLO**  
*(defensive)*  
She's eight. She didn't mean—

**SEMMI**  
I'm NOT OLD! I'm NOT some decrepit old man! I'm in my PRIME!

**BELLO**  
*(trying to de-escalate)*  
Nobody said you were old—

**SEMMI**  
She called me GRANDPA!

**BELLO**  
*(frustrated, blurting out)*  
Well you ACT old! With your outdated radios and your newspaper clippings and your obsession with the 1960s! It's like you lived in the Nazi era or something! Like you've heard of Felonious Gru— I mean, felonious charges and—

He stops, realizing what he just said.

**SEMMI** stares at him, face going white, then red.

**SEMMI**  
*(quietly, dangerously)*  
The Nazi era.

**BELLO**  
I didn't mean it like—

**SEMMI**  
You think I'm a NAZI? You think I'm some kind of CRIMINAL?

**BELLO**  
No! I just meant you're stuck in the past—

**SEMMI**  
GET OUT! GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! NOW!

He physically pushes **BELLO** and **MAY** toward the door.

**BELLO**  
Wait, I'm sorry—

**SEMMI**  
OUT!

He shoves them through the doorway, slams the door, locks it.

**BELLO** *(from outside, muffled)*  
Semmi! Open the door! I'm sorry! Let me—

**SEMMI** turns away from the door, breathing heavily.

Turns to face the remaining group: **GOOMO**, **RITA**, **MINA**, **MR. HOLT**, **NATALIE**, and **MARIA** (still clutching her torn shirt).

**SEMMI**  
*(coldly)*  
Closet. All of you. Except Maria.

**MARIA**  
*(terrified)*  
What?

**SEMMI**  
You're going exactly where you deserve to stand. By the clear wall near the kitchen. Meet the Baby gate.

He points to the spot near the wall where he would locked **MARIA** by, with a baby gate.

**MARIA**  
*(crying)*  
Please, no—

**SEMMI**  
*(to the others)*  
MOVE!

**GOOMO**  
Semmi, this is insane—

**SEMMI**  
*(pulling out a KNIFE from the kitchen)*  
I said. MOVE.

He's not threatening with it—not directly—but the implication is clear.

**MR. HOLT**  
*(hands up)*  
Okay. Okay. We're moving.

**RITA**  
*(to Maria)*  
It's going to be okay. We'll get out of this situation.

The four of them—**GOOMO**, **RITA**, **MINA**, and **MR. HOLT**—slowly move toward the closet.

**NATALIE**  
Where do you want me?

**SEMMI**  
*(considering)*  
With them. All of you in there.

**NATALIE** follows the others.

**SEMMI** opens the closet door. The smell is still awful. The mess still there.

**GOOMO**  
*(at the threshold)*  
You can't be serious.

**SEMMI**  
In. Now.

One by one, they file into the small closet. It's cramped. Five adults in a space meant for storage.

**SEMMI** closes the door. **LOCKS** it from outside.

Turns to **MARIA**, who's backed against the wall, still holding her torn shirt together.

**SEMMI**  
*(calmer now, almost gentle)*  
You. Sit there.

He points to the spot by the wall. Pulls out a **BABY GATE** from somewhere and sets it up, creating a small penned area.

**MARIA**  
*(shaking)*  
Please don't—

**SEMMI**  
Sit.

**MARIA** slowly sits down behind the baby gate, curling up small.

**SEMMI** locks the baby gate mechanism.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
Now. Everyone stays there until I've found Paddy and moved him somewhere appropriate. Then we'll... we'll figure out the rest.

From the closet: muffled protests, banging.

**GOOMO** *(muffled)*  
Semmi! Let us out!

**SEMMI** ignores them.

Walks through the house, calling out.

**SEMMI**  
Paddy? Paddy, boy? Where'd you go?

He searches—upstairs, other rooms.

**MARIA** sits behind the baby gate, shivering, crying quietly.

From outside, faintly: **BELLO** and **MAY** can be heard trying to get someone's attention, calling for help.

**SEMMI** returns to the living room, still no Paddy.

**SEMMI**  
*(to himself)*  
Where did he go? He never just leaves. He never...

He looks increasingly frantic.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(to Maria)*  
Where did you put him? Where did the dog GO?

**MARIA**  
*(terrified)*  
I don't know! I just... I shooed him and he left! I don't know where!

**SEMMI**  
You LOST my dog!

**MARIA**  
I didn't mean to!

**SEMMI**  
First you disrespect me, then you move my things, then you LOSE MY DOG!

He paces frantically.

From the closet: continuous muffled shouting.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
EVERYONE SHUT UP!

The noise from the closet quiets slightly.

**SEMMI** searches more desperately—checking under furniture, behind curtains.

Finally finds **PADDY** hiding under a table in the dining room, trembling.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(relieved)*  
There you are. There you are, boy.

He reaches for **PADDY**. The dog **GROWLS**.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
It's okay. It's me. It's—

**PADDY** **SNAPS** at him, teeth bared.

**SEMMI** pulls back, shocked.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
Paddy? What's wrong with you?

The dog growls again, backing further under the table.

**SEMMI** tries again. **PADDY** lunges, scratching him.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(bleeding)*  
You... you bit me. You scratched me.

He stares at his dog in disbelief.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
*(quietly)*  
Even you don't want me.

He sits down on the floor, staring at **PADDY** under the table.

**PADDY** growls softly, not approaching.

**SEMMI** puts his head in his hands.

The **DOCUMENTARY RADIO** continues playing.

The room is a disaster—high chair overturned, people locked away, blood on his arms from Paddy's scratches.

Everything falling apart.

### EXT. SEMMI'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

**BELLO** has **MAY** wrapped in his jacket. They're at a neighbor's house, **KNOCKING** desperately.

**BELLO**  
*(pounding on door)*  
Please! We need help! There are people trapped!

A **NEIGHBOR** (50s, cautious) opens the door a crack.

**NEIGHBOR**  
What's going on?

**BELLO**  
My friends are trapped in that house! The man who lives there—he's holding them against their will! We need to call the police!

**MAY**  
*(crying)*  
Please help them!

**NEIGHBOR**  
*(opening door wider)*  
Come inside. I'll call 911 right now.

They come inside as a first step, but the Neighbor is too afraid to check on him, so he runs off anyway.

---

### INT. SEMMI'S LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

**SEMMI** still sits on the floor, staring at nothing.

From the closet: the group has gone quiet, probably trying to conserve air or energy.

**MARIA** still sits behind the baby gate, watching him fearfully.

**SEMMI**  
*(quietly, to himself)*  
This wasn't how it was supposed to go.

**MARIA**  
*(small voice)*  
Can you let everyone out now? Please?

**SEMMI** doesn't respond.

**MARIA** *(CONT'D)*  
They can't breathe in there. There's too many people in a small space.

**SEMMI** looks at the closet door.

**SEMMI**  
They're fine.

**MARIA**  
They're not fine. Please. I'll... I'll stay here. I won't run. Just let them out.

**SEMMI**  
*(looking at her)*  
Why would you stay?

**MARIA**  
Because they're my friends. And you're... you're not okay. You need help.

**SEMMI**  
*(bitterly)*  
Everyone keeps saying that. That I need help. But nobody helps. They just leave. Or judge. Or tell me I'm weird.

**MARIA**  
You locked us in rooms. That's not just weird. That's... that's really bad.

**SEMMI**  
I know.

**MARIA**  
Then why did you do it?

**SEMMI**  
*(long pause)*  
I don't know.

Silence.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
I'm going to let them out.

**MARIA**  
Really?

**SEMMI**  
*(standing slowly)*  
FUCK NO!!!

---

### EXT. SEMMI'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

**BELLO** and **MAY** stand on the front lawn, shivering in the cold. Snow falling steadily.

**BELLO**  
*(panicking)*  
We have to get them out. We have to—

**MAY**  
*(pointing)*  
Hey, hey, hey! We still have one more chance, right!

Bello is confused initially.

He opens the door again, hoping to talk to Semmi.

---

### INT. SEMMI'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

They emerge into the same place they've went to before they've been kicked out.

Can hear the **DOCUMENTARY RADIO** still playing.

Can hear **PADDY** whimpering somewhere.

Can hear faint voices from the closet—**GOOMO** and the others, muffled.

**BELLO** and **MAY** move carefully toward the living room.

**SEMMI** is sitting on the mid-century couch, staring at nothing.

**MARIA** is still behind the baby gate, eyes red from crying.

She sees **BELLO** and **MAY**. Her eyes widen.

**BELLO** puts a finger to his lips.

They move quietly toward **SEMMI**.

**BELLO**  
*(softly)*  
Semmi.

**SEMMI** doesn't turn.

**BELLO** *(CONT'D)*  
*(stepping closer)*  
Semmi, I came back. I... I want to apologize. Face to face.

**SEMMI**  
*(quietly)*  
You broke into my house.

**BELLO**  
I needed to talk to you. To try one more time.

**SEMMI** finally turns to look at him.

His eyes are red. He's been crying.

**SEMMI**  
Why?

**BELLO**  
Because... because you're lonely. You're hurting. And I made it worse.

**SEMMI**  
*(laughing bitterly)*  
You think apologizing will fix this?

**BELLO**  
No. But maybe... maybe it's a start. You can let everyone go. We can get you help. Real help.

**SEMMI**  
Help. Everyone wants to "help" me. But nobody actually does. They just want to change me. Make me normal.

**BELLO**  
That's not what I—

**SEMMI**  
*(standing)*  
You said I lived in the Nazi era... You compared me to Hitler...!

**SEMMI**
*(transitions to being comedic)*
You have basically told me like a Nazi leader to not have to put my dog where it belongs anymore...!

**SEMMI**
*(imitating)*
And OOOOUOH, MR. HOLT, MY LEADER...!

**BELLO**
*(boiling in rage)*
SEMMI, STOP IT!

**MAY**  
*(stepping forward)*  
All because I called you grandpa. That was me. Bello didn't—

**SEMMI**  
Everyone's SORRY! But nobody means it! You're all just sorry you got caught here! Sorry I'm not who you thought I was!

**BELLO**  
You're right. We didn't know you. But we're trying to understand now.

**SEMMI**  
*(shaking his head)*  
It's too late for that.

**BELLO**  
It's not too late. You can still—

**SEMMI**  
*(loudly)*  
GET OUT!

**BELLO**  
Semmi, please, what do you mean—

**SEMMI**
*(screaming suddenly)*
FUCK YOU!

A long silence.

Then, sad music plays in the background.

**SEMMI** 
*(Showing Hitler Picture)*  
This is what I think of your apology. This is what I think of your "help."

**BELLO**  
*(desperate)*  
What about that? And what about the people in that closet? What about Maria?

**SEMMI**  
*(Putting back Hiter Picture in his pocket)*  
They stay until I decide otherwise.

**BELLO**  
You can't keep them there forever!

**SEMMI**  
Watch me.

He advances on **BELLO** and **MAY**, forcing them back toward the hallway.

**SEMMI** *(CONT'D)*  
You broke in. You trespassed. Get out before I call the police for REAL this time.

**BELLO**  
I'm not leaving without—

**SEMMI** grabs **BELLO** by the shirt, shoving him toward the basement stairs.

**SEMMI**  
OUT! THE WAY YOU CAME IN! NOW!

**MAY**  
*(to Maria)*  
We'll get you out! I promise!

**SEMMI**  
*(pushing them)*  
GO FUCK YOURSELVES YOU ASSHOLE, YOU'LL LEAVE ME ALONE!

He physically forces them back outside again whilst screaming.

This time, Semmi really slams his door hard shut.

---

### EXT. SEMMI'S HOUSE - ENTERANCE - CONTINUOUS

They're outside again.

**BELLO** leans against the house, breathing hard.

**MAY**  
What do we do now?

**BELLO**  
*(shivering)*
Brr...

**END OF ACT FOUR**
